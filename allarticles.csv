In this study, we propose a new PSO variant, namely, adaptive division of labor (ADOL) PSO (ADOLPSO), to overcome the demerits of our previous work. Specifically, an ADOL module is developed in ADOLPSO to adaptively regulate the exploration and exploitation searches of swarm. To achieve this purpose, both criteria of swarm diversity and fitness are considered during the task allocation process of the ADOLPSO current swarm. Two new operators, namely, convex operator and reflectance operator, are adopted to generate new particles from the memory swarm of ADOLPSO to further enhance the searching accuracy and convergence speed of the proposed algorithm. These two operators are activated to evolve the memory swarm only if a fitness improvement is observed in the current swarm of ADOLPSO to prevent excessive computational complexity. The proposed ADOLPSO is applied to solve 18 benchmark functions with various characteristics. Simulation results of ADOLPSO are compared with those of other nine well-established PSO variants. Experimental findings reveal that ADOLPSO significantly outperforms the other PSO variants in terms of searching accuracy, reliability, and convergence speed.","2015","2022-05-04 14:59:08","2022-05-16 21:55:52","","5887-5903","","14","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :26</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Weekly, daily and hourly natural gas futures prices from the New York Mercantile Exchange are used as target data. The types of strategies, the lengths of the time periods and the range parameters are coded into a binary string, and genetic algorithm is used to search for suitable lengths, appropriate calculation methods and other parameters. According to the results of three experiments using data at different time scales, the performances differ in type of moving average strategy selection and adoption of range parameter. Generally, experiments based on daily scale data show better performance than weekly and hourly scales in rate of return, return times and return stability.

In fact, two fuzzy decision support systems are developed. The first one uses fuzzy logic to design the trading rules and to apply the stock market technical indicators. The second one enhances this fuzzy trading system adding a fuzzy strategy to manage the capital to trade. Additionally, a new technical market indicator that produces short and long entry signals is introduced. It is based on the moving average convergence divergence indicator. Its parameters have been optimized by genetic algorithms. The proposals are compared to a classical nonfuzzy version of the proposed trading systems and to the buy-and-hold strategy. Results favor our fuzzy trading system in the two markets considered, NASDAQ100 and EUROSTOXX.

The proposed approach find the true number of clusters and the appropriate value of weighted exponent $(m)$ which is required to be known in advance to perform clustering using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. However, the selection of inappropriate value of $m$ and $C$ may lead the algorithm to converge to the local optima. To address the issue of selecting the appropriate value of $m$ and corresponding value of $C$. In QIE-FCM, the quantum concept is used in classical computer where $m$ is represented in terms of quantum bits (qubits). The QIE-FCM is based on generations. At each generation $(g)$, quantum gates are used to generate a new value of $m$.For each generated value of $m$ FCM algorithm is executed by varying values of $C$. Then, corresponding to $m$ value appropriate value of $C$ is identified by evaluating local fitness function for generation $g$. To achieve the global best value of $m$ and $C$, the global fitness function is evaluated by comparing the local best fitness value in current generation with the best fitness value obtained among all the previous generations. To judge the efficacy of QIE-FCM algorithm, it is compared with two well-known indices and three evolutionary fuzzy based clustering algorithm and their performance is evaluated on four benchmark datasets. Furthermore, the sensitivity of QIE-FCM is also experimentally investigated in this paper.","2015","2022-05-11 14:32:39","2022-05-16 21:50:53","","1-8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4RYCDCN6\7337861.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2A25VRDW\Patel et al. - 2015 - A Quantum-Inspired Fuzzy based Evolutionary algori.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Computer science; Clustering algorithms; Quantum computing; Algorithm design and analysis; Evolutionary computation; Partitioning algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, a framework using a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (GA) in its core to optimize a set of Trading or Investment Strategies (TSs) was developed. The investigated framework is used to determine potential buy, sell or hold conditions in stock markets, aiming to yield high returns at a minimal risk. The Volatility Index (VIX), indicators based on the VIX and other Technical Indicators (TI) are optimized to find the best investment strategy. Additionally, fair and established metrics are used to evaluate both the return and the linked risk of the optimized TSs. Furthermore, these strategies are evaluated in several markets using data from the main stock indexes of the most developed economies, such as: NASDAQ, S&P 500, FTSE 100, DAX 30, and also NIKKEI 225. The achieved results clearly outperform both the Buy&Hold and Sell&Hold. Additionally, the Pareto-Fronts obtained with the training data during the experiments clearly show the inherent trade-off between risk and return in financial. In this paper the option of using an adaptive approach was chosen, which led to the development of a framework able to operate continuously and with minimal human intervention. To sum up, the developed framework is able to evolve a set of TSs suitable for the diverse profiles of investors from the most risky to the most careful with interesting results, which suggests great potential in the framework generalization capabilities. The use of the VIX enables the system to increase the stock return compared to traditional Technical Indicators by avoiding losses when the stress in the stock market increases.

(Methods) The QPSO was utilized to detect the optimal point of the VAriance RAtio Criterion (VARAC), which was created by us as fitness function in the optimization model. The experimental dataset had 4 groups (400 data in total) with three various degrees of overlapping: non-overlapping, partial overlapping, and intensely overlapping. The proposed QPSO was compared with traditional global optimization algorithms: genetic algorithm (GA), combinatorial particle swarm optimization (CPSO), and firefly algorithm (FA) via running 20 times. (Results) The results demonstrated that QPSO could locate the best VARAC values with the least time among the four algorithms. (Conclusions) We can find that QPSO performs effectively and fast for the problem of cluster analysis.","2015","2022-05-05 17:54:45","2022-05-16 21:45:54","","285-293","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-27051-7_24","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, an investigation into the underlying theory that there exists repeating patterns within the time series data which forms the basis of technical analysis is conducted. The assumption that certain patterns do develop over time and the forex market does not fluctuate in a random manner is used to establish the fact that history repeats itself in forex trading.

These systems consist of sensors and cameras as well as image processing and decision support software components. They are meant to help drivers by providing proper warnings or by preventing dangerous situations. In this paper, we focus on the problem of design time testing of ADAS in a simulated environment. We provide a testing approach for ADAS by combining multi-objective search with surrogate models developed based on neural networks. We use multi-objective search to guide testing towards the most critical behaviors of ADAS. Surrogate modeling enables our testing approach to explore a larger part of the input search space within limited computational resources. We characterize the condition under which the multi-objective search algorithm behaves the same with and without surrogate modeling, thus showing the accuracy of our approach. We evaluate our approach by applying it to an industrial ADAS system. Our experiment shows that our approach automatically identifies test cases indicating critical ADAS behaviors. Further, we show that combining our search algorithm with surrogate modeling improves the quality of the generated test cases, especially under tight and realistic computational resources.","2016","2022-05-04 12:38:33","2022-05-16 21:38:29","","63-74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/28071/1/ASE16BenAbdessalem.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These applications have a big impact on both performance and energy consumption. Both metrics can be optimized selecting the best cache configuration for a target set of applications. Multi-objective optimization may help to minimize both conflicting metrics in an independent manner. In this work, we propose an optimization method that based on Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms, is able to find the best cache configuration for a given set of applications. To evaluate the goodness of candidate solutions, the execution of the optimization algorithm is combined with a static profiling methodology using several well-known simulation tools. Results show that our optimization framework is able to obtain an optimized cache for Mediabench applications. Compared to a baseline cache memory, our design method reaches an average improvement of 64.43 and 91.69% in execution time and energy consumption, respectively.","2016","2022-05-04 12:38:33","2022-05-16 21:38:10","","200-212","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To this end, in this paper, a new MOEA based on decomposition of a MOP into a number of constrained single-objective sub-problems (MOEA/D-MCS) is proposed. A MOP is firstly decomposed into a set of simple single-objective optimization sub-problems, and the objective space of the MOP is also decomposed into some number of sub-objective spaces. Then, each sub-objective space is considered as the feasible region of the corresponding single-objective problem. For each sub-problem, solutions of the feasible region are better than solutions of the infeasible region, which can maintain quite well the diversity of obtained solutions. Moreover, MOEA/D-MCS compares with MOEA/D UMOEA/D, GDRE3 d NSGAIII on six multi-objective benchmark functions. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain a set of solutions with better diversity and convergence.","2016-12","2022-05-04 15:02:54","2022-05-16 21:33:02","","33-38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\NMEXXKQE\7820408.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\59SGBSPF\7820408.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\HX43YS9E\7820408.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\WVCRMVVT\Dai and Lei - 2016 - A New Evolutionary Algorithm Based on Decompositio.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Artificial intelligence; Algorithm design and analysis; Approximation algorithms; Sociology; Evolutionary computation; Decomposition; Evolutionary algorithm; Multi-objective optimization; Pareto optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2016 12th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Security (CIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Structural optimization procedures can be effectively employed for performance-based optimal design of structures. In this study, bat algorithm (BA) is utilized to implement performance-based optimum seismic design of steel dual braced frames for various performance levels. The required structural seismic responses are evaluated by performing nonlinear pushover analysis. The results found by BA are then compared with those of obtained by other popular meta-heuristics such as firefly algorithm (FA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to provide an insight about its computational performance. Two numerical examples are presented and the numerical results reveal that the BA outperforms PSO and FA.","2016","2022-05-05 18:26:20","2022-05-16 21:24:40","2022-05-05 18:26:20","95-114","","","","","","","Modeling and Optimization in Science and Technologies","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-26245-1_5","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\5DDQAHC2\Gholizadeh and Poorhoseini - 2016 - Performance-Based Optimum Seismic Design of Steel .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Bat algorithm; Dual braced frame; Earthquake; Meta-heuristic; Performance-based design; Steel structure","Yang, Xin-She; Bekdaş, Gebrail; Nigdeli, Sinan Melih","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

That means not only identical in the interfaces and dimensions but also in the internal properties. These properties are firmly integrated in the software of connected hardware components. In this paper, an approach towards generic interfaces is proposed to identify this information and provide it on the communication interface. Furthermore, the influence of the specific information is reduced by an deployment optimization. Additionally, the communication overhead as well as necessary changes from a given original deployment are considered. A realistic case study is used to demonstrate the practicability of the proposed approach. It shows that it is possible to modify an existing application towards a generic communication interface.

Clustering based color image segmentation algorithms segment an image by clustering the features of color and texture, thereby obtaining accurate prototype cluster centers. In the proposed algorithm, the color features are obtained using the homogeneity model. A new texture feature named Power Law Descriptor (PLD) which is a modification of Weber Local Descriptor (WLD) is proposed and further used as a texture feature for clustering. Genetic algorithms are competent in handling binary variables, while differential evolution on the other hand is more efficient in handling real parameters. The obtained texture feature is binary in nature and the color feature is a real value, which suits very well the hybrid cluster center optimization problem in image segmentation. Thus in the proposed algorithm, the optimum texture feature centers are evolved using genetic algorithms, whereas the optimum color feature centers are evolved using differential evolution.","2016","2022-05-04 14:49:21","2022-05-16 21:20:23","","1182-1186","","5","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://etasr.com/index.php/ETASR/article/download/799/386</p>; <p>http://etasr.com/index.php/ETASR/article/download/799/386</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, an efficient discrete optimization algorithm is proposed for PBDO of SBF utilizing a deformation-based method. Two difficulties exist in PBDO of SBF, and the first one is that multiple performance constraints are imposed on the structures. To avoid tackling all constraints simultaneously, a strategy is proposed in which the deformation constraints of beams and columns are strictly followed throughout the optimization process and the brace deformation constraints are checked again at the end of the optimization. The second difficulty is that the search for an optimum design is conducted in a discrete design space since the structural elements are usually taken from standard sections. A common practice is to use regression models for the sections, at the expense of removing sections that cannot fit into the regression models from the design space. In this paper all standard sections are preserved by using the cross-sectional area (Area) and moment of inertia (Ix) as the design variables, thus any standard section can be uniquely defined by its Area and Ix. To investigate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm, three numerical examples are presented. Compared to the results achieved by genetic algorithm (GA) and differential evolution (DE), the proposed algorithm can achieve better or comparable structural designs. Furthermore, the convergence rate of the proposed algorithm is much higher than GA and DE, proving that the proposed algorithm is an efficient optimization method for PBDO of SBF.","2020","2022-05-05 18:23:30","2022-05-15 18:52:49","","567-584","","","","","","","Mechanisms and Machine Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PPHY443C\Wang et al. - 2020 - Performance-Based Design Optimization of Steel Bra.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Efficient discrete algorithm; Performance-based design optimization; Steel braced frame","Okada, Hiroshi; Atluri, Satya N.","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this article, an efficient discrete optimization algorithm is proposed for performance-based design optimization of steel frames. The computational efficiency is improved by searching in a sensible manner, guided by the deformation information of structural elements. To include all standard sections in the design space, the cross-sectional area (Area) and moment of inertia (Ix) are selected as the design variables. Based on different relationships between Area and Ix, a twofold strategy is put forward, which includes a quick exploration and an elaborate exploitation. For comparison, a similar algorithm is also proposed, using Area as the only design variable. A fixed relationship between Area and other sectional properties is used. Two numerical examples are presented to minimize the structural weight while satisfying performance constraints. The results indicate that the proposed discrete algorithm can achieve lighter structural designs than the area-only algorithm. Furthermore, the convergence history proves that a high computational efficiency can be realized by using the proposed algorithm.","2020-02-01","2022-05-05 18:23:26","2022-05-15 18:52:45","2022-05-05 18:23:26","411-423","","3","23","","Advances in Structural Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM","<p>Cited By :11</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MAXKWHKQ\Wang et al. - 2020 - An efficient discrete optimization algorithm for p.pdf","","excluded; not an application","computational efficiency; discrete optimization algorithm; performance-based design optimization; twofold strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, the problem of resource leveling of linear projects under the framework of LSM is studied. Firstly, the concept of a third type of float is proposed, and the advantages of this third type of float to the optimization of linear project resource leveling are analyzed. On this basis, a two-stage optimization process of the linear project resource leveling problem based on the third type of float is proposed. The process takes into account new constraints such as total resource constraint, resource utilization constraint, and construction mileage constraint, and it aims to maximize the space-time flexibility of construction activities and realize the depth optimization of linear project resource leveling. According to the integer nonlinear characteristic of the model, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with a constraint processing mechanism and particle search range restriction is designed. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed model is verified by case analysis and comparison of the results in previous studies.","2020","2022-05-03 16:13:11","2022-05-15 18:51:46","","176997-177020","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09207731.pdf</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09207731.pdf</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09207731.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AGUAJ3LJ\9207731.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\FPWAKFEV\Wang et al. - 2020 - Float-Based Resource Leveling Optimization of Line.pdf","","included","Genetic algorithms; Heuristic algorithms; Resource management; Schedules; Optimal scheduling; Acceleration; project management; Linear project; optimal scheduling; quantum particle swarm; resource leveling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the performance of convergence process and the probability of detecting global extremum, a combination model updating method of modified particle swarm optimization (MPSO) and response surface method was proposed herein. MPSO has less modification to PSO as only modifying the particle position with Gaussian white noise at a probability and the performance was significantly superior than PSO illustrated by testing functions. A beam model updating example based on the proposed method was tested, the convergence ability and accuracy were compared with genetic algorithm which is widely applied in bridge model updating.

The search strategy of the HGSO is very simple, which results in the algorithm having poor exploitation ability and unable to find a more accurate optimal solution. The Harris Hawk optimization algorithm (HHO) has strong exploitation because of its diverse exploitation strategies. In order to make up for the shortcomings of HGSO algorithm, this article proposes an improved Henry gas solubility optimization algorithm (HHO-HGSO) based on the Harris Hawk optimization. During the iteration, taking the escaping energy function of the HHO algorithm as an indicator and determining a threshold, when the escaping energy function value is greater than the threshold, the algorithm conducts the search strategy of the HGSO algorithm, when less than the threshold, executes four exploitation strategies of Harris Hawk. In order to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm, HHO-HGSO is used to optimize CEC2005 and CEC2017 benchmark test functions and solve 4 real engineering design problems. Marine predators algorithm (MPA), Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Lightning search algorithm (LSA), Water cycle algorithm (WCA), HGSO, and HHO were used to conduct comparative experiments.

The modified compound algorithm was used to optimize parameters of the RBF network. A temperature prediction model was established through the fitting of pixels and temperatures of the infrared image of an equipment. After image matching, the infrared temperature at a position can be directly obtained from the visible image. Meanwhile, we can also directly read temperature values of different positions from the infrared image and identify the corresponding positions in the visible image. Experimental results indicate that the algorithm proposed has a better prediction performance than the RBF network optimized by OLSA alone and by adaptive genetic algorithm (AGA) and OLSA. It improves the generalization capacity of RBF network, resulting a more stable input and a higher prediction accuracy. The algorithm proposed facilitates temperature analysis and condition-based maintenance for substations.","2020","2022-05-04 12:26:00","2022-05-15 18:49:39","","012028","","1","431","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://doi.org/10.1088/1755-1315/431/1/012028</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, due to the format of problems that quantum annealing solves and the structure of the physical annealer, these problems often require additional setup prior to solving. We study how these setup steps affect performance and provide insight into the interplay among them using the job-shop scheduling problem for our evaluation. We show that the empirical probability of success is highly sensitive to problem setup and that excess variables and large embeddings reduce performance. We then show that certain problem instances are unable to be solved without the use of additional post-processing methods. Finally, we investigate the effect of pausing during the anneal. Our results show that pausing within a certain time window can improve the probability of success, which is consistent with other work. However, we also show that the performance improvement due to pausing can be masked depending on properties of the embedding, and thus, special care must be taken for embedded problems.","2020-12-16","2022-05-04 10:58:25","2022-05-15 17:24:09","2022-05-04 10:58:25","32-48","","4","7","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c)","","","","superfri.org","","Number: 4","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8YUMIYIQ\Zielewski et al. - 2020 - Improving Quantum Annealing Performance on Embedde.pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We propose QAML-Z, an algorithm that iteratively zooms in on a region of the energy surface by mapping the problem to a continuous space and sequentially applying quantum annealing to an augmented set of weak classifiers. Results on a programmable quantum annealer show that QAML-Z matches classical deep neural network performance at small training set sizes and reduces the performance margin between QAML and classical deep neural networks by almost 50% at large training set sizes, as measured by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The significant improvement of quantum annealing algorithms for machine learning and the use of a discrete quantum algorithm on a continuous optimization problem both opens a class of problems that can be solved by quantum annealers and suggests the approach in performance of near-term quantum machine learning towards classical benchmarks.","2020-12-04","2022-05-04 10:33:26","2022-05-15 17:15:25","2022-05-04 10:33:26","062405","","6","102","","Phys.

Эта функция, как правило, имеет высокую размерность и множество локальных экстремумов. Подобная задача успешно решается популяционными алгоритмами оптимизации, например, алгоритмом роя частиц, алгоритмом пресноводных гидр и другими. Целью работы являлось совершенствование алгоритма пресноводных гидр (Н-алгоритма) с учетом представлений квантовой механики. Разработанные квантовые модификации данного алгоритма основаны на методе анализа иерархий (QH-AHP) и байесовском подходе (QH-B). Скорость сходимости квантовых модификаций выше, чем у исходного Н-алгоритма в связи с тем, что положение особей определяется напрямую, не оперируя их скоростями (в соответствии с представлениями квантовой механики). Вследствие этого, в течение одной итерации особи могут перемещаться на значительное расстояние, в результате чего увеличивается охват пространства поиска. Кроме того, данный подход позволяет особям успешнее преодолевать области притяжения локальных экстремумов, что препятствует преждевременной сходимости алгоритма. Найдены оптимальные значения параметров разработанных алгоритмов в результате решения задачи метаоптимизации. Сравнение скорости сходимости предложенных алгоритмов оптимизации выполнялось на примере различных многоэкстремальных тестовых функций: Розенброка, Дэвиса, Экли, Растригина. Предложенные квантовые модификации Н-алгоритма (QH-AHP и QH-B) для различных тестовых функций показали различную, но в среднем одинаковую скорость сходимости. Скорость сходимости квантовых модификаций алгоритмов для различных тестовых функций выше, чем у исходного алгоритма пресноводных гидр и алгоритма роя частиц. Разработанные алгоритмы решения задачи оптимизации могут быть использованы при обучении нейронных сетей, при математическом моделировании процессов и систем в различных предметных областях на этапе идентификации параметров модели, оптимизации характеристик и построения оптимального управления такими системами и т. д.","2020-06-15","2022-05-11 16:32:16","2022-05-15 17:15:20","2022-05-11 16:32:16","37-48","","2","","","","","","","","","","","ru","Copyright (c)","","","","journals.vsu.ru","","Number: 2","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\F59M5FL7\Королев and Майков - 2020 - Квантовая модификация алгоритма пресноводных гидр .pdf","","excluded; not english","алгоритм роя частиц; байесовский подход; задача метаоптимизации; задача оптимизации; квантовый алгоритм пресноводных гидр; метод анализа иерархий","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework’s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods.

The MPA is proposed for first finding the optimal weights and biases of the neural network based on a Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute Error minimization objective function. Real life dataset obtained from an anonymous data centre operator in Cape Town, South Africa was used for the model implementation. The dataset was made up of a total of 564 samples and was split into training and testing set using an 80:20 ratio. The input variables contained in the dataset are the data centre’s ambient temperature, ambient relative humidity, chiller output temperature and Computer Room Air Conditioning supply temperature while the energy demand is the target variable. The optimal weights of the neural network model were analysed using a weights-based approach to determine the level of influence each input parameter of the model has on the data centre’s energy demand. Then based on the predicted energy demand of the data centre, a dynamic economic and emission dispatch problem is solved for the building while considering thermal and solar photovoltaic generations. A spinning reserve is also incorporated in the energy dispatch model to cater for any shortfall that may exist between the predicted and actual energy demand of the data centre due to possible inaccuracies in the energy demand prediction model. Results for the energy demand prediction task showed that the proposed method outperformed the state-of-the-art by producing the least Mean Squared Error, Root Mean Squared Error, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Absolute Percentage Error and highest prediction accuracy for the training and testing sets. Further analyses also highlighted that the data centre’s ambient temperature has the highest influence of about 37.63% on its energy demand pattern. For the energy dispatch task, the proposed method also identified solar photovoltaic as the preferred energy source over conventional thermal generators in fulfilling the objective function, depending on its availability. Overall, the findings presented in this study emphasize the robustness of the proposed method in solving the problems considered and its potential application towards solving even more complex problems.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:16","2022-05-15 17:10:42","","3760-3774","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.06.062</p>; <p>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.egyr.2021.06.062</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\G28ZPGW4\Ajayi and Heymann - 2021 - Data centre day-ahead energy demand prediction and.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Artificial Neural Networks; Data Centre; Economic and Emission Dispatch; Energy Demand Forecasting; Marine Predators Algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a complicated multiple mode problem. In this investigation, a novel optimization technique, namely, a multi-gradient particle swarm optimization (MG-PSO) algorithm with two stages for exploring and exploiting the search space area, is employed as an optimization tool. The M particles (explorers) in the first stage are used to explore new neighborhoods, whereas the M particles (exploiters) in the second stage are used to exploit the best neighborhood. The M particles’ negative gradient variation in both stages causes the equilibrium between the global and local search space capabilities. This algorithm’s authentication is demonstrated on five medium-scale to very large-scale power systems. The MG-PSO algorithm effectively reduces the difficulty of handling the large-scale DED problem, and simulation results confirm this algorithm’s suitability for such a complicated multi-objective problem at varying fitness performance measures and consistency. This algorithm is also applied to estimate the required generation in 24 h to meet load demand changes. This investigation provides useful technical references for economic dispatch operators to update their power system programs in order to achieve economic benefits.","2021-01","2022-05-11 15:43:32","2022-05-15 17:10:33","2022-05-11 15:43:32","1274","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 3 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/3/1274/pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\55ZGWE93\Al-Bahrani et al. - 2021 - Solving the Real Power Limitations in the Dynamic .pdf","","excluded; not an application","dynamic economic dispatch; multi-gradient PSO algorithm; ramp-rate limitations; real power of large-scale thermal power units; valve-point loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The combination of Air-based High-Temperature Heat and Power Storage (HTHPS), which is known as a novel energy storage technology, with a wind farm as an integrated system can make new opportunities for a Generation Company (GenCo) to over­ come the wind generation challenges. This paper proposes a novel Stochastic Multi-objective Optimization (SMOO) problem to determine the optimal charging and discharging scheduling and the best bidding strategy in the day-ahead energy market for an integrated energy system including a wind farm and HTHPS unit. The proposed model presents a comprehensive and coherent approach from historical data analysis as input to final decision making as output, that it can maximize Genco’s profit by avoiding incorrect commitment and energy offering. In the phase of uncertainty handling, via a scenario-based approach, the wind uncertainty is modeled by Monte-Carlo Simulation (MCS) method based on wind speed forecast errors. In the optimization phase, the Pareto optimal set is obtained by Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm-II (NSGA-II), and then, a new method is also provided to choose the best possible solution based on the entropy Technique for Order Perfor­ mance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method and the minimax regret criterion.

The power balance constraint is described by a chance constraint to consider the impact of WP intermittency on the EEDP solution.

To tackle this issue, novel performance-based design procedures are proposed in this study. The novel PBSD procedures commence with integrating the optimization and simplification techniques into the preliminary design stage to rapidly obtain an optimal initial amount of materials required to establish outrigger and ladder systems models. Then, conducting a nonlinear time history analysis with the aid of ETABS and Peforme-3D software to scrutinize the extent to which the initial design approaches the final design and the superiority of each system under frequent or rare earthquake events. The global and component responses are examined for each system under three performance levels: immediate occupancy IO, life safety LS, and collapse prevention CP. The optimization and simplification techniques in the preliminary design stage have reduced the overwhelming efforts required to generate and prepare an optimized preliminary design for both systems. Furthermore, the results of the nonlinear time history analysis found that the ladder system reduced the structure's global response by 27.2% for the lateral displacement and 30.4% for the base shear than the outrigger system. However, the evaluation of the components acceptance criteria confirmed that the ladder system increased the plastic damage distribution in the external structural system's components and reduced it in the internal one. Generally, the preliminary design approached the final design by varied ratios, 60–80% in the ladder system and 60–95% in the outrigger system for different components. Therefore, it is recommended to apply this approach to the outrigger system and improve the ladder system's efficiency. Finally, this study is limited to an optimized preliminary design that approaches the final design and reduces the iteration number of the PBSD procedures. Thus further researches are required to improve and extend the applicably of these procedures.","2021-12-01","2022-05-05 18:22:42","2022-05-15 17:10:16","2022-05-05 18:22:42","2288-2307","","","34","","Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DWANNQTA\Amoussou et al. - 2021 - Performance-based seismic design methodology for t.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\H2TSCI9T\S2352012421007906.html","","excluded; not an application","Ladder system; Nonlinear time history analysis; Outrigger system; Performance-Based Seismic Design (PBSD); Preliminary design; Tall buildings","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solution of MKP involves two levels of choice – one for selecting an item to be placed and the other for selecting the knapsack in which it is to be placed. Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms (QIEAs), a subclass of Evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective in solving difficult problems particularly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. QIEAs provide a general framework which needs to be customized according to the requirements of a given problem to obtain good solutions in reasonable time. An existing QIEA for MKP (QIEA-MKP) is based on the representation where a Q-bit collapse into a binary number. But decimal numbers are required to identify the knapsack where an item is placed. The implementation based on such representation suffers from overhead of frequent conversion from binary numbers to decimal numbers and vice versa. The generalized QIEA (GQIEA) is based on a representation where a Q-bit can collapse into an integer and thus no inter conversion between binary and decimal is required. A set of carefully selected features have been incorporated in proposed GQIEA-MKP to obtain better solutions in lesser time. Comparison with QIEA-MKP shows that GQIEA-MKP outperforms it in providing better solutions in lesser time for large sized MKPs. The generalization proposed can be used with advantage in other Combinatorial Optimization problems with integer strings as solutions.","2021","2022-05-04 12:07:50","2022-05-15 17:10:08","","22-50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-8593-1.ch002","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We start by formulating synchronization into a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO). While such formulation respects the binary nature of the problem, ensuring that the result is a set of permutations requires extra care. Hence, we: (i) show how to insert permutation constraints into a QUBO problem and (ii) solve the constrained QUBO problem on the current generation of the adiabatic quantum computers D-Wave. Thanks to the quantum annealing, we guarantee global optimality with high probability while sampling the energy landscape to yield confidence estimates.

An adaptive contraction expansion factor is also introduced which ensures better exploration of the algorithm. The technique is applied to solve the combined economic emission dispatch of a hybrid solar thermal unit operating in New Delhi, India for full and reduced solar radiation. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed technique, it is also applied to solve the combined economic emission dispatch of a 10 unit, 2000 MW system.

Continuous-time quantum computing (CTQC) encompasses continuous-time quantum walk computing (QW), adiabatic quantum computing (AQC), and quantum annealing (QA), as well as other strategies which contain elements of these three.  While much of current quantum computing research focuses on the discrete-time gate model, which has an appealing similarity to the discrete logic of classical computation, the continuous nature of quantum information suggests that continuous-time quantum information processing is worth exploring.  A versatile context for CTQC is the transverse Ising model, and this thesis will explore the application of Ising model CTQC to classical optimization problems.    Classical optimization problems have industrial and scientific significance, including in logistics, scheduling, medicine, cryptography, hydrology and many other areas.  Along with the fact that such problems often have straightforward, natural mappings onto the interactions of readily-available Ising model hardware makes classical optimization a fruitful target for CTQC algorithms.  After introducing and explaining the CTQC framework in detail, in this thesis I will, through a combination of numerical, analytical, and experimental work, examine the performance of various forms of CTQC on a number of different optimization problems, and investigate the underlying physical mechanisms by which they operate.","2021-03","2022-05-04 11:11:18","2022-05-15 17:06:55","2022-05-04 11:11:18","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en-US-GB","Creative Commons Attribution NonCommercial Licence","","","","spiral.imperial.ac.uk","","Accepted: 2021-09-09T10:26:11Z Publisher: Imperial College London","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2XH9W3FK\Callison - 2021 - Continuous-time quantum computing.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\5EF3NBBY\91503.html","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, there are relatively few tools to understand the opposite limit of rapid quenches, as used in quantum annealing and (in the limit of infinitely rapid quenches) in quantum walks. In this paper, we develop several tools that are applicable in the rapid-quench regime. Firstly, we analyze the energy expectation value of different elements of the Hamiltonian. From this, we show that monotonic quenches, where the strength of the problem Hamiltonian is consistently increased relative to fluctuation (driver) terms, will yield a better result on average than random guessing. Secondly, we develop methods to determine whether dynamics will occur locally under rapid-quench Hamiltonians and identify cases where a rapid quench will lead to a substantially improved solution. In particular, we find that a technique we refer to as “preannealing” can significantly improve the performance of quantum walks. We also show how these tools can provide efficient heuristic estimates for Hamiltonian parameters, a key requirement for practical application of quantum annealing.","2021-03-04","2022-05-04 10:35:29","2022-05-15 17:06:37","2022-05-04 10:35:29","010338","","1","2","","PRX Quantum","","","","","","","","","","","","","APS","","Publisher: American Physical Society","<p>http://link.aps.org/pdf/10.1103/PRXQuantum.2.010338</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\IXZUT2NH\PRXQuantum.2.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\XVTGSTSK\Callison et al. - 2021 - Energetic Perspective on Rapid Quenches in Quantum.pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To overcome the deficiency of TSA in solving environmental economic power dispatch (EED) problem with high-dimensional, nonlinear, and non-convex characteristics, this article proposes a novel multiobjective tree seed algorithm (MONTSA), which possesses superior ability to obtain Pareto optimal solution (POS) sets. For expanding the search space as well as balancing the ability of exploration and exploitation about TSA, three modification strategies, including dynamic search tendency (ST), Gaussian mutation mechanism and variation mechanism of differential evolution algorithm based on Cauchy mutation strategy are adopted to constitute MONTSA. In addition, a constraint handling technique to make sure zero constraint violation and non-inferior sorting approach based on dynamic crowding distance are also put forward. The above introduced strategies allow MONTSA to obtain POS with better distribution. Eight cases, containing four objectives of fuel cost, pollution emission, power loss and fuel cost with valve point effect, are experimented on IEEE 30 bus, IEEE 57 bus and IEEE 118 bus test systems. The results reveal that, compared with MOTSA and MOPSO/MODE, MONTSA is effectively capable of addressing EED problem, which is able to obtain uniformly distributed Pareto frontiers (PFs) and better best compromise solution (BCS). Eventually, the performance indicators GD and HV show that PFs and BCS obtained by MONTSA are more outstanding than the rest of algorithms, with uniform distribution, strong convergence and powerful stability.","2021","2022-05-03 17:14:38","2022-05-15 17:05:53","","17","","4","48","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\P2IL2E9W\Chen et al. - 2021 - Environment Economic Power Dispatch from Power Sys.pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We even find that a 2000Q quantum annealer with a drastically less connected hardware graph but using the domain-wall encoding can outperform the next-generation Advantage processor if that processor uses one-hot encoding.","2021","2022-05-03 15:40:56","2022-05-15 17:05:48","","1-14","","","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Quantum Engineering","<p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8924785/9347847/09485068.pdf</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8924785/9347847/09485068.pdf</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/8924785/9347847/09485068.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\E9QXG8IT\9485068.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\B84YUPYB\9485068.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\BI4Y589X\9485068.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\6FV3T9HP\9485068.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TW6PFSGB\Chen et al. - 2021 - Performance of Domain-Wall Encoding for Quantum An.pdf","","excluded; not an application","quantum computing; Optimization; Annealing; Hardware; Encoding; Qubit; Measurement; Analogue computer; optimization methods; Space exploration","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Although previous works propose solutions to reduce CO2 emission and production cost, an optimal allocation needs to be considered on both cost and emission-leading to combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED). Metaheuristic optimization algorithms perform relatively well on ELD problems. The gradient-based optimizer (GBO) is a new metaheuristic algorithm inspired by Newton's method that integrates both the gradient search rule and local escaping operator. The GBO maintains a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Also, the possibility of the GBO getting stuck in local optima and premature convergence is rare. This paper tests the performance of GBO in solving ELD and CEED problems. We test the performance of GBO on ELD for various scenarios such as ELD with transmission losses, CEED and CEED with valve point effect. The experimental results revealed that GBO has been obtained better results compared to eight other metaheuristic algorithms such as Slime mould algorithm (SMA), Elephant herding optimization (EHO), Monarch butterfly optimization (MBO), Moth search algorithm (MSA), Earthworm optimization algorithm (EWA), Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) Algorithm, Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA) and Chimp Optimization Algorithm (ChOA). Therefore, the simulation results showed the competitive performance of GBO as compared to other benchmark algorithms.","2021","2022-05-11 16:28:11","2022-05-15 17:00:23","","44322-44338","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","<p>Cited By :21</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09380140.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7KRZKYQY\Deb et al. - 2021 - Recent Methodology-Based Gradient-Based Optimizer .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Economics; Valves; Search problems; Power systems; Fuels; optimization; combined economic and emission dispatch (CEED); economic load dispatch (ELD); Gradient-based optimizer (GBO); metaheuristics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Metaheuristic optimization methods have been successfully used for solving engineering design problems over the last three decades. A very recently developed metaheuristic method called school-based optimization (SBO) will be utilized in the performance-based optimum seismic design of steel frames for the first time in this study. The SBO actually is an improved/enhanced version of teaching–learning-based optimization (TLBO), which mimics the teaching and learning process in a class where learners interact with the teacher and between themselves. Ad hoc strategies are adopted in order to minimize the computational cost of SBO results. The objective of the optimization problem is to minimize the weight of steel frames under interstory drift and strength constraints. Three steel frames previously designed by different metaheuristic methods including particle swarm optimization, improved quantum particle swarm optimization, firefly and modified firefly algorithms, teaching–learning-based optimization, and JAYA algorithm are used as benchmark optimization examples to verify the efficiency and robustness of the present SBO algorithm. Optimization results are compared with those of other state-of-the-art metaheuristic algorithms in terms of minimum structural weight, convergence speed, and several statistical parameters. Remarkably, in all test problems, SBO finds lighter designs with less computational effort than the TLBO and other methods available in metaheuristic optimization literature.","2021-10-01","2022-05-05 18:22:53","2022-05-15 17:00:14","2022-05-05 18:22:53","3283-3297","","4","37","","Engineering with Computers","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8AMTTD7W\Degertekin et al. - 2021 - School-based optimization for performance-based op.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Structural optimization; Performance-based design; Pushover analysis; School-based optimization; Steel frames","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the calculations at the cooperative and trade industry offices, some constants are used as benchmarks to assess the increase and decrease in prices of basic foodstuffs, namely the CPI (Consumer Price Index).Support vector regression (SVR) is one of the appropriate methods to solve regression problems based on the concept of maximizing the hyperplane to obtain data that is a support vector. The selection of this method is based on the level of MSE (mean square error) which is lower than the neural network method. As a test material, a sample dataset of staple food prices for the past 5 years was used. Where for training data using a sample of 2013-2014 with a total of 24 records, and testing data using a sample of 2015-2016 as many as 24 records.In this study, the researcher tried to apply multiple kernels in the Support Vector Regression method to predict the CPI (Consumer Price Index).

The Ising model is the typical choice to describe the interactions between the spins in the networks. Here, we explore the interplay of different interaction types between the spins and the structure of the underlying network on the performance of QA. Specifically, we consider the Heisenberg XY and antisymmetric anisotropic exchange interaction models, in addition to the usual Ising Model, in graph structures ranging from linear chains to complete graphs with different connectivities. We find that the QA performance of the Ising model shows less variation with the change of graph structure among different interaction types. The Heisenberg XY model suffers from significant performance losses with increasing connections beyond linear chains, which we attribute to increasing entropy built-up. Anisotropic exchange interactions turn out to be an impractical choice for complete graphs due to the diminishing energy gap during annealing. Furthermore, we investigate the effect of inhomogeneous couplings and reveal a trade-off between coupling strength and performance, especially significant for the case of the anisotropic exchange model.","2021-12-17","2022-05-04 12:00:42","2022-05-15 16:54:39","2022-05-04 12:00:42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2111.11411","Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures, corrections of typos and grammar, added analysis in subsection anisotropic coupling, added reference for coherence results, updated abstract, introduction, and conclusions","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\HTIPD8EF\Ege and Müstecaplıoğlu - 2021 - Effects of Graph Network Connections on The Effici.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7N3DFMYX\2111.html","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The benchmarking of these devices has been controversial. Initially, random spin-glass problems were used, however, these were quickly shown to be not well suited to detect any quantum speedup. Subsequently, benchmarking shifted to carefully crafted synthetic problems designed to highlight the quantum nature of the hardware while (often) ensuring that classical optimization techniques do not perform well on them. Even worse, to date a true sign of improved scaling with the number of problem variables remains elusive when compared to classical optimization techniques. Here, we analyze the readiness of quantum-annealing machines for real-world application problems. These are typically not random and have an underlying structure that is hard to capture in synthetic benchmarks, thus posing unexpected challenges for optimization techniques, both classical and quantum alike. We present a comprehensive computational scaling analysis of fault diagnosis in digital circuits, considering architectures beyond D-Wave quantum annealers. We find that the instances generated from real data in multiplier circuits are harder than other representative random spin-glass benchmarks with a comparable number of variables. Although our results show that transverse-field quantum annealing is outperformed by state-of-the-art classical optimization algorithms, these benchmark instances are hard and small in the size of the input, therefore representing the first industrial application ideally suited for testing near-term quantum annealers and other quantum algorithmic strategies for optimization problems.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:23","2022-05-13 21:41:54","","014004","","1","12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://link.aps.org/accepted/10.1103/PhysRevApplied.12.014004</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, to realize this promise to its fullest extent we must appropriately leverage the underlying physics. In this spirit, we examine how the well-known tendency of quantum annealers to seek solutions where more quantum fluctuations are allowed can be used to trade off optimality of the solution to a synthetic problem for the ability to have a more flexible solution, where some variables can be changed at little or no cost. We demonstrate this tradeoff experimentally using the reverse annealing feature a D-Wave Systems quantum processing unit for both problems composed of all binary variables, and those containing some higher-than-binary discrete variables. We further demonstrate how local controls on the qubits can be used to control the levels of fluctuations and guide the search. We discuss places where leveraging this tradeoff could be practically important, namely in hybrid algorithms where some penalties cannot be directly implemented on the annealer and provide some proof-of-concept evidence of how these algorithms could work.","2020-12-09","2022-05-04 10:34:09","2022-05-13 21:41:45","2022-05-04 10:34:09","062606","","6","102","","Phys.

This is also the case of problems in structural and earthquake engineering whose solution is generally based on the so-called “engineer’s judgment”. However, heuristic theories and algorithms within the framework of “soft computing” can provide a more rational and systematic way to approach and solve problems in these areas. As a matter of fact, the aforementioned algorithms have been recently utilized in several branches of engineering and applied sciences. This paper proposes a state-of-the-art review of the main applications of soft computing techniques to relevant structural and earthquake engineering problems. Specifically, the applications of fuzzy computing, evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence, and neural networks, as well as their hybrid combinations, are analyzed with the aim to examine their capability and limitations in modeling, simulation, and optimization problems.","2020-03-15","2022-05-05 18:23:23","2022-05-13 21:41:36","2022-05-05 18:23:23","110269","","","207","","Engineering Structures","Soft computing techniques in structural and earthquake engineering","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :40</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\X25H55J8\Falcone et al. - 2020 - Soft computing techniques in structural and earthq.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Fuzzy logic; Swarm intelligence; Earthquake engineering; Evolutionary computing; Neural network; Structural engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In December 2019 in China (Wuhan), the spread of SARS-CoV-2 has taken the shape of a pandemic and affects the respiratory system and manifests as pneumonia in humans, influencing more than 216 nations so far. On January 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) gave the name “2019-nCoV” for 2019 novel Coronavirus, and the infection further on February 11th, 2020, is authoritatively named as COVID-19. Instead of using various predictive systems and data models, the prevalence of COVID-19 is continuously increasing, affecting millions of individuals. This chapter focuses on predictive systems and data models utilized from the beginning of COVID-19 outbreak that helped in predicting the cases and deaths qualities of COVID-19 in the desire for giving a reference to future investigations and help in controlling the spread of further epidemics. And also suggest how these data models can help and enable policymakers to plan the regional and national healthcare systems required and design monitored active plans.","2021","2022-05-04 14:58:02","2022-05-13 21:33:55","","123-164","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-8534-0_7","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Most of them either focused on solving newly re-formulated problems or on proposing new approaches, while a number of studies performed reviews and comparative studies on the performance of proposed algorithms. To evaluate such performance, it is necessary to consider a number of performance metrics that play important roles during the evaluation and comparison of investigated algorithms based on their best-simulated results. While there are hundreds of performance metrics in the literature that can quantify in performing such tasks, there is a lack of systematic review conducted to provide evidence of using these performance metrics, particularly in the software engineering problem domain. In this paper, we aimed to review and quantify the type of performance metrics, number of objectives, and applied areas in software engineering that reported in primary studies—this will eventually lead to inspiring the SBSE community to further explore such approaches in depth. To perform this task, a formal systematic review protocol was applied for planning, searching, and extracting the desired elements from the studies. After considering all the relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria for the searching process, 105 relevant articles were identified from the targeted online databases as scientific evidence to answer the eight research questions. The preliminary results show that remarkable studies were reported without considering performance metrics for the purpose of algorithm evaluation. Based on the 27 performance metrics that were identified, hypervolume, inverted generational distance, generational distance, and hypercube-based diversity metrics appear to be widely adopted in most of the studies in software requirements engineering, software design, software project management, software testing, and software verification. Additionally, there are increasing interest in the community in re-formulating many objective problems with more than three objectives, yet, currently are dominated in re-formulating two to three objectives.","2021","2022-05-04 12:38:44","2022-05-13 21:33:51","","3117","","7","11","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/11/7/3117/pdf</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Researchers expect 6G to have higher bandwidth, coverage, reliability, energy efficiency, lower latency, and, more importantly, an integrated ""human-centric"" network system powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Such a 6G network will lead to an excessive number of automated decisions made every second. These decisions can range widely, from network resource allocation to collision avoidance for self-driving cars. However, the risk of losing control over decision-making may increase due to high-speed data-intensive AI decision-making beyond designers and users' comprehension. The promising explainable AI (XAI) methods can mitigate such risks by enhancing the transparency of the black box AI decision-making process. This survey paper highlights the need for XAI towards the upcoming 6G age in every aspect, including 6G technologies (e.g., intelligent radio, zero-touch network management) and 6G use cases (e.g., industry 5.0). Moreover, we summarised the lessons learned from the recent attempts and outlined important research challenges in applying XAI for building 6G systems.

"XZQEHNFT","report","2021","Wang, Yanbai Andrea; Weinstein-Tull, Justin","Pandemic Governance","","","","","https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3887153","The COVID-19 pandemic created an unprecedented need for governance by a multiplicity of authorities. The nature of the pandemic—globally communicable, uncontrolled, and initially mysterious—required a coordinated response to a common problem. But the pandemic was superimposed atop our decentralized domestic and international governance structures, and the result was devastating: the United States has a death rate that is eighteenth highest in the world, and the pandemic has had dramatically unequal impacts across the country. COVID-19’s effects have been particularly destructive for communities of color, women, and intersectional populations.This Article finds order in the chaos of the pandemic response by distilling a typology for the predominant intergovernmental relationships that emerged. Two of these behaviors describe intergovernmental conflict. Governments undermined each other by destabilizing and criticizing each other’s actions. They did so at all levels: up (when local governments undermined states), down (when the federal government undermined states), and across (when the federal government undermined itself). Governments abdicated responsibility when they failed to act. Two additional behaviors describe intergovernmental coordination. Governments collaborated when they actively worked together, both vertically and horizontally, to harmonize their policies. And they engaged in bandwagoning when they avoided taking initiative in making pandemic policy, opting instead to follow the leads of others. We argue that these behaviors were the predictable result of well-worn structural and political dynamics. Structurally, pandemic policy lies uncomfortably on two poles of the federal-state division of responsibilities. Ambiguous hierarchies and overlapping roles pushed governments toward conflict rather than coordination. Politically, intense partisanship transformed nearly every governance decision into symbolic, two-sided national battles. These battles provided a default set of relationships that became organizing principles for the pandemic response. We use these insights to sketch the contours of a way forward. To address the role confusion that arose from our multi-sovereigned system of governance, we propose a federal pandemic statute that emphasizes and balances role clarity, state independence, and explicit governmental action that disrupts inequality. To lessen the pull of partisanship, we advocate for the creation of decentralized but inclusive subject-matter networks among international, federal, state, and local authorities.","2021-07-14","2022-05-03 17:33:08","2022-05-13 21:32:12","2022-05-03 17:33:08","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.3887153","","","","excluded; not a primary study","local government; health; Covid; federalism; governance; international law; pandemic; state government","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","3887153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to increase the operational flexibility of coal-fired power plant, a 600 MW subcritical coal-fired power plant was selected as research example to analyze the influence of steam extraction parameters and operation load by simulation. A novel main steam extraction system was proposed to adjust the power output under the low load period. The sensible and latent heat of the extracted steam was stored in molten salts and phase change materials, respectively, during the load reduction process. While the stored heat was reused again to heat the feed water and condensate water during the load raising process. The 50% rated load (300.03 MW) of the unit was used as the research benchmark to further adjust the load. The results show that the proposed steam extraction system can improve the operational flexibility of coal-fired power plant. The power output can be reduced to 204.51 MW from 300.03 MW when the main steam extraction mass flow rate is 250 t/h during the load reduction process. The sensible heat storage power factor and the operation load of the unit can affect the power output increment of coal-fired power plant during the load raising process. Under the condition of the maximal sensible heat storage power factor is 0.2462, the power output can be increased to 325.47 MW from 300.03 MW when the bypassed feed water mass flow rate of 251 t/h was heated by the stored heat during the load raising process. Using such operation model, the coal-fired power plant can achieve the maximum deep peak shaving time of 8.4 h/d, and its equivalent thermal efficiency is increased by 2.28%. With the same stored thermal energy to heat the bypassed feed water of 308.65 t/h, the power output can be increased to 394.2 MW from 360.07 MW (60% rated load) at the same sensible heat storage power factor of 0.2462 during the load raising process, and the coal-fired power plant can achieve the maximum deep peak shaving time of 9.86 h/d with its equivalent thermal efficiency increase of 2.55%. The results show that the proposed steam extraction method can make the unit operate in the lowest stable load and provide a wider renewable energy access space below the minimum stable load.

In this study, a hybrid methodology that combines the Gaussian-white-noise-mutation particle swarm optimization (GMPSO), back-propagation neural network (BPNN) and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) technique is proposed. In this approach, as a meta-heuristic algorithm with the least modification to the standard PSO, GMPSO simultaneously offers convenient programming and good performance in optimization. The BPNN with LHS establishes the meta-models for FEM to accelerate efficiency during the updating process. A case study of the model updating of an actual bridge with no distribution but bounded parameters was carried out using this methodology with two different objective functions. One considers only the frequencies of the main girder and the other considers both the frequencies and vertical displacements of typical points. The updating results show that the methodology is a sound approach to solve an actual complex bridge structure and offers good agreement in the frequencies and mode shapes of the updated model and test data. Based on the shape comparison of the main girder at the finished state with different objective functions, it is emphasized that both the dynamic and static responses should be taken into consideration during the model updating process.","2021-01-01","2022-05-05 18:23:15","2022-05-13 21:31:19","2022-05-05 18:23:15","213-221","","1","20","","Earthq.

In this paper, a standalone Photovoltaic (PV)-battery-methanation HES is proposed to provide adequate, reliable and cost-effective electricity and gas to the local consumers. Identifying a potential solution to maximize the reliability of the system, asked by consumers, and to minimize costs required by the investors is challenging. Bi-level programming is adopted in this study to tackle the pre-mentioned issue. In the outer layer, an optimal design is obtained by means of particle swarm optimization. In the inner layer, an optimal operation strategy is found under the optimal design of the outer layer using sequential quadratic programming. The results indicate that 1) The bi-level programming used in this study can find the optimal solution; 2) The proposed HES is proved to be able to supply power and gas simultaneously. 3) Compared with the right most and leftmost points on Pareto set, the total costs are reduced by 17.77% and 2.16%.","2021-04-01","2022-05-03 16:00:41","2022-05-13 21:30:47","2022-05-03 16:00:41","440-456","","","167","","Renewable Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\6R2SECK7\Xu et al. - 2021 - Enhanced design of an offgrid PV-battery-methanati.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Design; Bi-level programming; Hybrid energy system; Offgrid; Power/gas supply","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the application of energy hubs results in scheduling challenges for the entire system due to the mutual impact of various energy forms and the increase in the number of uncertain variables. One of the parameters of an energy storage system, which is an indispensable component of an energy hub, is the state-of-charge at the end of the first day of scheduling. This parameter is crucial because its final state represents the initial state-of-charge for the second day, which has an effect on the operational cost of the second day. Based on a look-ahead risk-constrained technique, this work investigates the optimal scheduling of an energy hub for two days with the aim of minimizing the total operational cost. The state-of-charges of an energy storage system at the end of the first day is optimized by considering the scheduling result on the second day. The uncertainties of the two days are demonstrated via various scenarios. Additionally, a demand response program is adopted to reduce the total operational cost and increase the system flexibility. The results validate the feasibility of using look-ahead risk-constrained scheduling in an energy hub and indicate that a reduction in the total operational cost is achieved.","2021-09-01","2022-05-03 15:57:24","2022-05-13 21:30:44","2022-05-03 15:57:24","117109","","","297","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AICIM27J\Xu et al. - 2021 - Look-ahead risk-constrained scheduling for an ener.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Energy hub; Mixed-integer linear programming; Demand response program; Risk-constrained scheduling","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus it is imperative to investigate the utilization of clean electricity in buildings. This study proposes a novel, cost-effective commercial building-oriented power supply system for providing a comfortable environment in a shopping mall. An energy management strategy is also proposed for this system. Two types of electric vehicles (EVs) are considered, and their models are developed separately based on different stochastic behaviors. Furthermore, the integration of retired electric vehicle batteries (REVBs) in commercial buildings is one of the possible methods for achieving echelon utilization. To address the uncertainties in the system, the scenario-based stochastic optimization method is applied, which formulates the energy management problem as a mixed-integer linear programming model. Results show that by integrating only photovoltaic (PV) energy and both PV and REVBs into commercial buildings, reductions of 82.2% and 83.3%, respectively, in the expected operational cost can be achieved. This proves that the application of PV and REVBs is beneficial for commercial buildings. Moreover, the robustness of the employed method is proven through comparison with other methods.","2021-02-15","2022-05-03 16:01:11","2022-05-13 21:30:42","2022-05-03 16:01:11","113831","","","230","","Energy Conversion and Management","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ZM8TT74B\Xu et al. - 2021 - Risk management strategy for a renewable power sup.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Commercial building; Electric vehicle; Renewable energy; Retired electric vehicle battery; Risk management strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper presents a novel forecasting model for stock markets on the basis of the wrapper ANFIS (Adaptive Neural Fuzzy Inference System)-ICA (Imperialist Competitive Algorithm) and technical analysis of Japanese Candlestick. Two approaches of Raw-based and Signal-based are devised to extract the model's input variables with 15 and 24 features, respectively. The correct predictions percentages for periods of 1–6 days with the total number of buy and sell signals are considered as output variables. In proposed model, the ANFIS prediction results are used as a cost function of wrapper model and ICA is used to select the most appropriate features. This novel combination of feature selection not only takes advantage of ICA optimization swiftness, but also the ANFIS prediction accuracy. The emitted buy and sell signals of the model revealed that Signal databases approach gets better results with 87% prediction accuracy and the wrapper features selection obtains 12% improvement in predictive performance regarding to the base study. In addition, since the wrapper-based feature selection models are considerably more time-consuming, our presented wrapper ANFIS-ICA algorithm's results have superiority in time decreasing as well as increasing prediction accuracy as compared to other algorithms such as wrapper Genetic algorithm (GA).","2015","2022-05-04 14:58:53","2022-05-13 21:29:59","","9221-9235","","23","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :38</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/125253/1/Final_manuscript_2.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The ubiquitous in-network caching is a key NDN feature. However, pervasive caching strengthens security problems namely cache pollution attacks including cache poisoning (i.e., introducing malicious content into caches as false-locality) and cache pollution (i.e., ruining the cache locality with new unpopular content as locality-disruption). In this paper, a new cache replacement method based on Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) is presented to mitigate the cache pollution attacks in NDN. The ANFIS structure is built using the input data related to the inherent characteristics of the cached content and the output related to the content type (i.e., healthy, locality-disruption, and false-locality). The proposed method detects both false-locality and locality-disruption attacks as well as a combination of the two on different topologies with high accuracy, and mitigates them efficiently without very much computational cost as compared to the most common policies.","2015","2022-05-04 14:59:02","2022-05-13 21:29:51","","51-65","","","80","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :51</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>https://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/2117/76980/2/ANFIS-based%20Caching.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Similarly, adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) is also one of the commonly used machine learning techniques which employs training algorithm to adjust its parameters to approximate the problem under consideration. Even though, ANFIS is used in wide variety of applications including rule-based control systems, classification, and pattern matching, but ANFIS has drawback of computational complexity as it carries the problem of curse of dimensionality. This limits ANFIS to be used only with the applications having less number of inputs. Additionally, the gradient-based learning algorithm suffers from the problem of trapping in local minima. To address these drawbacks, this study reduces ANFIS architecture from five to four layers, in order to reduce model complexity. Moreover, to avoid the local minima problem in typical hybrid learning algorithm, the popular swarm-based metaheuristic algorithm Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) is used to solve the benchmark classification problems with varying input-size. The overall comparison of results and experiments show that the modified ANFIS model performed equally better as compared to standard ANFIS, but with significantly reduced trainable parameters and training computation cost. The modified ANFIS reduced the model complexity up to 93% on classification problems with large input-size.","2019","2022-05-04 14:58:29","2022-05-13 21:29:17","","36-47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-03302-6_4","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

By selecting alternative routes for some shipment paths, we optimize the trade-off between merging partially filled trucks using fewer trucks in total and the increase in distance associated with shipment rerouting. The goal of the optimization is thus to minimize the total distance travelled for all trucks transporting shipments. The problem instances and techniques used to model the optimization are drawn from real-world data describing an existing shipment network in Europe.

Traditional energy storage planning methods usually only take the economy optimization as the objective. These methods have difficulty meeting the requirement of reliability. The co-optimization of economy and reliability has been regarded as a new target. However, this new target is difficult to be achieved because of the complexity of energy storage resources in UIES and the nonlinearity of mathematical formulation to express the reliability. Therefore, how to achieve the maximum comprehensive improvement of economy and reliability within the limited scope of planning resources is a key issue that needs to be resolved. Adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES) has the capability of combined cooling, heating and power supply. The incorporation of A-CAES in UIES can improve the system economy and reliability effectively. To this end, a reasonable bi-level optimal planning method for A-CAES combined with heat/cold energy storage is proposed considering the economy and reliability co-optimization. Firstly, the mathematical formulations of economy and reliability objectives are presented separately. To unify the two planning objects, the reliability object is transformed from the minimum outage capacity into the minimum outage penalty cost, which is regarded as the reliability cost. The reliability cost and economy cost are integrated as the objective function of the planning level. Then, based on the rated power and capacity of A-CAES obtained from the planning level, the optimal scheduling model of UIES is established for evaluating the annual system operation cost and reliability cost. Finally, a UIES containing an A-CAES is used for simulation analysis. The simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve the comprehensive optimization of economy and reliability.","2021-08-01","2022-05-03 15:59:16","2022-05-13 21:27:54","2022-05-03 15:59:16","102691","","","40","","Journal of Energy Storage","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4BXJ8XRD\Yin et al. - 2021 - An economy and reliability co-optimization plannin.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\U6RKZ5IP\S2352152X2100428X.html","","excluded; not an application","Economic analysis; Optimal planning; Adiabatic compressed air energy storage (A-CAES); Reliability assessment; Urban integrated energy system (UIES)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, pipe rack is a skeletal industrial structure subjected to various types of loading such as gravity, seismic, piping, and thermal forces. While there are many studies on design optimization of the most common structures, only a limited number of studies exist on optimal design of industrial structures. In this article, a design optimization problem is proposed for weight minimization of steel pipe rack structures, and then the problem is solved through three meta-heuristic algorithms consisting of a modified particle swarm optimization (PSO), grey wolf optimizer (GWO), and the recently developed improved grey wolf optimizer (IGWO).

Tie-line capacity between different areas, upper/lower generation limits, generator ramp rates, transmission losses, valve point effect, disjoint prohibited zones as well as spinning reserve are considered as the MAED problem constraints. Due to hourly load variations, the MAED problem should be solved dynamically to coincide the realistic conditions which build up the multi-area dynamic economic dispatch (MADED) problem. Considering these constraints besides the intertemporal constraints which depends to the optimal conditions of each hour with respect to other time steps may increase the problem complexity. In this regard, an improved version of fireworks algorithm which is equipped with two effective cross-generation mutation strategies is deployed to handle the non-linear, non-smooth, non-convex, multi-dimensional and multi-constraints MADED problem. Furthermore, a new constraint handling scheme is developed to correct the potential solutions in feasible search space. Finally, two small and large systems are used to investigate the capability of the developed algorithm in finding the global or near-global optima.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:11","2022-05-13 21:19:58","","106579","","","126","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ZPDVCEBS\Zare et al. - 2021 - Reserve constrained dynamic economic dispatch in m.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Economic dispatch; Improved fireworks algorithm; Interconnected network; Multi-area restrictions","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In such contexts, a typical requirements review process often prioritizes requirements, due to limited time and monetary budget, by, for instance, prioritizing requirements with higher implementation cost earlier in the review process. However, such a requirement implementation cost is typically estimated by stakeholders who often lack knowledge about (future) requirements implementation scenarios, which leads to uncertainty in cost overrun. In this article, we explicitly consider such uncertainty (quantified as cost overrun probability) when prioritizing requirements based on the assumption that a requirement with higher importance, a higher number of dependencies to other requirements, and higher implementation cost will be reviewed with the higher priority. Motivated by this, we formulate four objectives for uncertainty-wise requirements prioritization: maximizing the importance of requirements, requirements dependencies, the implementation cost of requirements, and cost overrun probability. These four objectives are integrated as part of our search-based uncertainty-wise requirements prioritization approach with tool support, named as URP. We evaluated six Multi-Objective Search Algorithms (MOSAs) (i.e., NSGA-II, NSGA-III, MOCell, SPEA2, IBEA, and PAES ) together with Random Search ( RS ) using three real-world datasets (i.e., the RALIC, Word, and ReleasePlanner datasets) and 19 synthetic optimization problems. Results show that all the selected MOSAs can solve the requirements prioritization problem with significantly better performance than RS . Among them, IBEA was over 40% better than RS in terms of permutation effectiveness for the first 10% of prioritized requirements in the prioritization sequence of all three datasets. In addition, IBEA achieved the best performance in terms of the convergence of solutions, and NSGA-III performed the best when considering both the convergence and diversity of nondominated solutions.","2021","2022-05-04 12:38:44","2022-05-13 21:18:57","","1-54","","1","30","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we employed an analytical approach to calculate the hoop and radial stresses at the crown and sidewall of the storage cavity under the given cavity depth (h), the dimension of the cavity (W/H), the ratio of horizontal-to-vertical geologic stresses (K), and the internal air pressure (Pin). A good match of the hoop and radial stresses were observed for all tested parameters. The analysis of stress paths implies that the mechanical stability at the crown of the storage cavity could be a decisive factor for allowable storage pressure ranges. The allowable maximum storage pressure (Pmaxallow) can be determined at the moment when the stress path touches the tensile failure criterion, while the allowable minimum storage pressure (Pminallow) needs to be set to maintain stress paths below the shear failure envelope. A higher K and W/H values are advantageous for securing higher storage pressure, and the energy storage capacities are estimated between 1 and 10 MJ/m3 from this study.","2021-04-15","2022-05-03 16:00:53","2022-05-13 21:18:31","2022-05-03 16:00:53","119861","","","221","","Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PWLNP3ZA\Zhang et al. - 2021 - Geomechanical and energy analysis on the small- an.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Energy management; Energy storage; Compressed air energy storage; Geomechanics; Salt dome","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After introducing the free quantity of the model order, the accuracy of the prevenient grey-based models can be further enhanced. We selected the data for carbon dioxide production by Germany, Japan, and Thailand for modeling. To obtain the optimal order of our grey model, we selected four optimizers to search for the order. The results show that although the search history of the four types of optimizers is different, the search results are the same, which proves that the four types of optimizers are stable and reliable, and the order for which we searched is reliable.

However, few papers conduct convincing research into the complementary operation of MRES. This paper investigates the complementarities in MRES that contains wind, photovoltaic, run-off hydro, pumped storage power plants and incorporates complementarity into optimal operation of MRES. The complementarity is theoretically summarized and firstly classified into natural and synthetical one. To effectively capture the uncertainty and complementarity of RESs, the time-dependent clustering simulation technique is employed to generate the joint-scenarios. An equivalent run-off hydropower plant index is proposed, based on which a novel complementary operation model that considers volatility and self-sufficient adequacy is established. Results are presented and compared in the case study, which demonstrate the validity and scalability of the proposed methodology, reveal the complementarities under multiple time-scales, and illustrate the significance of complementary operation.","2021","2022-05-03 16:05:23","2022-05-13 21:14:06","","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: CSEE Journal of Power and Energy Systems","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RCYCZVQ3\9606943.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\HGB78ECK\Zhu et al. - 2021 - Complementary operation of multi-renewable energy .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Indexes; Uncertainty; Autoregressive processes; Renewable energy sources; Wind; complementarity; Correlation; fuzzy-c means clustering; Hydroelectric power generation; multi time-scale; multi-renewable energy system; optimal operation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

So, the ancillary power plants and services have found a good position in power systems. In this paper, renewable energy generators such as wind energy units and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are being integrated in the multi-objective dynamic economic emission dispatch (DEED) problem during a day, which minimizes wind-thermal electrical energy cost and emissions obtained by fossil-fueled power generators at the same time. To obtain a real-world problem, consider several practical and nonlinear constraints such as valve-point effect, ramp-up/ramp-down, prohibited zones, and power generation boundaries. Since the proposed multi-objective problem consists of different variables and constrains, the classical mathematic methods cannot guarantee finding the best solution. Therefore, this paper suggested a new multi-objective virus colony search (MOVCS) based on non-dominated sorting theory and fuzzy decision making for finding the best solution among Pareto fronts. Also, PEVs are remarkable and stochastic power demands and, unlike conventional demands, four dissimilar charging scenarios are considered. The efficiency of the proposed method and model is investigated on some test systems with the presence of wind units and electric vehicles during the day and night. The results are evaluated based on appropriate performance criteria. The results obtained from the proposed algorithm are compared with other algorithms, which indicates the efficiency, accuracy, and speed of this algorithm in solving the proposed problem.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:14","2022-05-13 21:13:39","","102722","","","67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CC3STBJ6\Zou et al. - 2021 - Solving dynamic economic and emission dispatch in .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Electric vehicles; Renewable energy; Multi-objective algorithm; Optimal power and pollution distribution; Virus colony search","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new algorithm, called Chaotic Social Group Optimization (CSGO), results from including the sequences generated by chaotic maps in the heuristics specific to the SGO algorithm. The performance of the CSGO chaotic algorithm is tested on four systems having various dimensions (10-units, 20-units, 30-units, and 40-units) and characteristics. The SGO and CSGO algorithms are compared with each other and with other algorithms. The obtained results indicate that CSGO algorithms equipped with any of the chaotic maps mentioned has a higher average performance than SGO algorithm.

The proposed method performs demand-aware offloading to meet the concurrent service dissemination requirements. Network-level caching and its forecast in concurrent service distribution are performed to reduce the response time. The offloading and caching processes are streamlined using deep recurrent learning for the failing service distribution intervals. In the learning process, the machine is trained for prior failures and for pursuing offloading instances. Based on the learning output, the caching level and offloading rate are determined for the queuing services. The performance of the proposed method is verified using the metrics service ratio, response failures, latency, offloading rate, and caching ratio.","2022-01-01","2022-05-04 11:27:39","2022-05-13 21:12:47","2022-05-04 11:27:39","224-235","","","181","","Computer Communications","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\BD5IN2QM\Alqahtani et al. - 2022 - A proactive caching and offloading technique using.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\36TM7WR8\S0140366421003959.html","","excluded; not an application","Deep learning; Data caching; Mobile edge computing; Service offloading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

There is a due date and a quality specification for each product. These products are generated from raw materials available in a set of silos and must satisfy the required quality specifications. The aim is to minimize the total production time and the total tardiness. To solve it, we developed a decision support system that applies a matheuristic algorithm to do the product schedule and determine the amount of raw material to produce each product. In the proposed algorithm, the products generated in each work shift are chosen through a dispatch heuristic rule based on the shortest production time. In turn, the amount of raw material to be used is calculated by solving a goal linear programming formulation of a blending problem.

In Process Systems Engineering, such problems appear in applications ranging from optimal process design and synthesis, process planning, scheduling, and control, and molecular design. Albeit their many applications that arise from its universal modeling capabilities, finding optimal solutions to these optimization problems is a challenging task, given the computational complexity associated with their solution. The design of novel algorithms and the correct modeling of these problems arise among the different ways to overcome this complexity. In particular, tackling these problems with the correct combination of mathematical modeling and solution procedure is an efficient strategy to address them. The objective of this Thesis is to propose new solutions and modeling methods for nonlinear discrete optimization problems, which lead to improvements with respect to the existing solution approaches. We initially pose the discrete nonlinear optimization problems in the context of Mathematical Programming. The problems that we consider solving here can be classified as Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) problems. In Chapter 2 we provide a review on the different solution algorithms and existing software to deterministically solve a subclass of MINLP problems called convex MINLP. Among those algorithms, we consider the Outer-approximation (OA) method, which decomposes the MINLP into a Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming (MILP) problem and a Nonlinear Programming (NLP) problem. We perform a large computational study comparing the performance of more than sixteen different software implementations, solvers, by solving over 350 convex MINLP problems from benchmark library MINLPLib. This large study allowed us to identify how the different solvers perform based on features from the problem to be solved. Chapter 3 presents the implementation of the feasibility pump algorithm in the commercial MINLP solver DICOPT. This algorithm is being used as a preprocessing step to enhance the solver’s capabilities to find feasible solutions early in the search for the optimal solutions. The approach described and implemented in this chapter improved the solver performance becoming the default setting for DICOPT when solving convex MINLP problems. In Chapter 4 we propose a new algorithm for convex MINLP, the Center-cut algorithm.Using a decomposition of the problem similar to OA, this algorithm relies on finding the Chebyshev center of the linear approximation of the nonlinear constraints. Although this algorithm is deterministic, in the sense that we provide convergence guarantees for it, it behaved remarkably well in finding feasible solutions quickly. Chapter 5 presents the derivation of scaled quadratic underestimators for convex functions and their usage in an OA framework, denoted Outer-approximation with quadratic cuts (OA-QCUT). Using those quadratic underestimators, the decomposition in OA then requires the solution of a Mixed-Integer Quadratically Constrained Programming (MIQCP) problem, which more closely underestimates the nonlinearities in convex MINLP problems, achieving a reduction in iterations when solving these problems. Chapter 6 then presents another modification of OA, where auxiliary Mixed-IntegerQuadratic Programming (MIQP) problems are solved at each iteration of OA. These auxiliary MIQP problems minimize a quadratic distance metric to the best-found solution in the algorithm while guaranteeing an improvement in the estimated objective function, hence stabilizing the OA method. These methods are successful at reducing the total number of iterations in OA at the expense of the solution of the auxiliary problem, which we prove needs not be solved to optimality, leading to performance improvements of the OA method when solving convex MINLP. Chapter 7 generalizes the concepts of Chapter 6 by showing that the auxiliary mixed integer problem can have any regularization objective function. We prove the convergenceguarantees of this method and show its equivalence of integrating a trust-region constraint in OA. This method is denoted Regularized Outer-approximation (ROA). We implemented these algorithms as part of the open-sourceMixed-integer nonlinear decomposition toolboxfor Pyomo - MindtPy and tested them extensively with all convex MINLP problems in the library MINLPLib. The results suggest an improvement of the existing OA and LP/NLPmethods by using regularization.","2022-02-09","2022-05-04 11:08:50","2022-05-13 21:10:43","2022-05-04 11:08:50","","","","","","","","","","","","Carnegie Mellon University","","en","","thesis","","","kilthub.cmu.edu","","DOI: 10.1184/R1/19146305.v1","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CRVPQPZE\Bernal Neira - 2022 - Modern Computational Approaches to Nonlinear Discr.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\5BGQ9UMW\19146305.html","","excluded; not a primary study","Quantum Computing; Discrete Nonlinear Optimization; Generalized Disjunctive Programming; MINLP; Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Programming; Process Systems Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In general, single-layer feedforward networks (SLFNs) can provide satisfactory forecasting results, but classical gradient-based learning algorithms are time consuming and easily trapped into local optimums. As a new training method for SLFNs, extreme learning machine (ELM) has faster training speed and stronger nonlinear mapping than gradient-based algorithms, and provides an effective technique for hydrologic time-series prediction. However, ELM may converge to local minimums in some cases due to the random determination of input weights and hidden biases. Thus, in order to overcome the shortcomings of ELM, this paper introduces a novel ELM–quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) model (ELM-QPSO) combining the advantages of ELM and QPSO. The proposed model adopts the QPSO algorithm to select the optimal input-hidden weights and hidden biases of ELM, and uses the Moore–Penrose generalized inverse to analytically determine the output weights. The proposed approach is assessed with daily runoff data of Xinfengjiang reservoir in China from January 1, 2000 to December 31, 2014. The results indicate that the ELM-QPSO can significantly improve the generalization performance of ELM for hydrologic time-series prediction, and that QPSO is an alternative training algorithm for ELM parameters selection.","2018-03-01","2022-04-27 15:57:57","2022-05-12 16:17:00","2022-04-27 15:57:57","04018002","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","EN","©2018 American Society of Civil Engineers","","","","ASCE","","Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers","<p>Cited By :65</p>; <p>Cited By :66</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\KTQG6KIW\Niu et al. - 2018 - Forecasting Daily Runoff by Extreme Learning Machi.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Hydrologic time series; Artificial neural network; Daily runoff prediction; Extreme learning machine (ELM); Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ITNK88F2","conferencePaper","2020","Sheng, Jiangfan; Kong, Weijian; Qi, Jie","Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spinning coagulation process based on surrogate model","2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","","","10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779","","High-quality carbon fiber precursor is the key to the manufacture of high-performance carbon fiber, and the coagulation process is one of the key steps in the preparation of the precursor. This coagulation process is an industrial process with complex mechanism and strict control accuracy requirements. Therefore, iterative optimization based on its strict mechanism model will be much time-consuming. In order to reduce the computational cost, a process optimization method for the coagulation process of carbon liber precursor spinning based on surrogate model was proposed. Using meta-modeling technology, this paper constructs the surrogate model which describes the relationship between the key operating parameters and the main output variables in the coagulation process. In the process of constructing the surrogate model, an evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion is adopted to improve the accuracy of the model. And the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is applied for searching operating parameters in the design space. The simulation results show that the proposed method not only provides a group of satisfactory operating parameters, but also greatly reduces the calculation cost.","2020-11","2022-04-11 15:14:47","2022-05-12 15:41:31","","6816-6821","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2688-0938","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\5S56PYE9\9326779.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\KN7RFETR\9326779.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UESCYFJ7\Sheng et al. - 2020 - Process optimization of carbon fiber precursor spi.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CAC51589.2020.9326779","included; forward snowball; reverse snowball","Process control; Mathematical model; Particle swarm optimization; Computational modeling; Carbon; Coagulation; quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; carbon fiber precursor; coagulation process; evolutionary optimal sample point insertion criterion; Spinning; surrogate model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 Chinese Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Linked to it is the issue of evolution, which, as reviewed here, is conjectured to vary from a development to fulfill some predestined design to a random process without any meaning or reason per se. A recently developed Operations Research model opens up the possibility of mathematically expressing the evolution of both social and biological systems and thus predicting their future course. The anthropic principle from cosmology which proposes the occurrence of natural phenomena to be dependent on the observer lends another dimension to this issue. The centrality of the human being, which is also supported by the results of quantum mechanics and anticipatory control theory, suggests that one purpose of life could be to direct evolution to overcome cosmic limits through technological advances.","1994-01-01","2022-04-11 15:14:57","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","435-444","","4","17","","Journal of Social and Evolutionary Systems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","","","excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This interval is called the lifetime of the order. The servicing device moves along a queue, allotting for each order a random time - a servicing quantum. The situation of a heavy load is investigated; that is, it is assumed that the lifetime is much greater than the duration of a service quantum and the average interval between arrivals in the system. Three types of motion of the device are examined: forward motion, from the beginning to the end of the queue, inverse motion, from the end to the beginning, and shuttle motion, from the beginning to the end of the queue and back. Limiting distributions are obtained for the number of times orders appearing in the system are serviced in a stationary regime.","1988","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","78-86","","1","26","","Soviet journal of computer and systems sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","","","OPERATIONS RESEARCH; PROBABILITY; excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

QGA is suitable for parallel structures because of rapid convergence and good global search capability.

The bi-objective problem is converted into a single objective one by price penalty factor. The proposed method, denoted as QPSO-DM, combines the QPSO algorithm with differential mutation operation to enhance the global search ability. In this study, heuristic strategies are proposed to handle the equality constraints especially water dynamic balance constraints and active power balance constraints. A feasibility-based selection technique is also employed to meet the reservoir storage volumes constraints. To show the efficiency of the proposed method, different case studies are carried out and QPSO-DM is compared with the differential evolution (DE), the particle swarm optimization (PSO) with same heuristic strategies in terms of the solution quality, robustness and convergence property.

First, the destination to which ant want to move is selected according to the select probability based on pheromone information and heuristic information. Then, the ant's own qubits are updated by quantum rotation gates so as to move. Some ants' qubits are mutated by quantum non-gate so as to increase the diversity of positions. Finally, both information of the pheromone and the heuristic are updated according to the new position of each ant. In this algorithm, both probability amplitudes of a qubit are regarded as position information, a double searching efficiency is acquired for ant colony which hold the fixed number of ants. The availability of the proposed algorithm is illustrated by simulation examples of function extremum optimization.","2010-08","2022-04-25 15:18:18","2022-04-28 11:29:24","","2989-2993","","","6","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2157-9563","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\QMRUBJZ9\5583935.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\G5CSLGVH\Li et al. - 2010 - Quantum ant colony optimization with application.pdf","","excluded; not recent","Optimization; Ant colony optimization; Quantum computing; Logic gates; Algorithm design and analysis; Convergence; Encoding; quantum computation; qnt colony optimization; quantum ant colony optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2010 Sixth International Conference on Natural Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the performance of the QEA, this paper proposes research issues on QEA such as a termination criterion, a Q-gate, and a two-phase scheme, for a class of numerical and combinatorial optimization problems. A new termination criterion is proposed which gives a clearer meaning on the convergence of Q-bit individuals. A novel variation operator H/sub /spl epsi// gate, which is a modified version of the rotation gate, is proposed along with a two-phase QEA scheme based on the analysis of the effect of changing the initial conditions of Q-bits of the Q-bit individual in the first phase. To demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the updated QEA, several experiments are carried out on a class of numerical and combinatorial optimization problems. The results show that the updated QEA makes QEA more powerful than the previous QEA in terms of convergence speed, fitness, and robustness.","2004-04","2022-04-25 15:14:17","2022-04-28 11:29:24","","156-169","","2","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\64QAFMZS\1288054.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\9DWMJ3UY\1288054.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MW4E62EF\1288054.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DFCPSZTE\Han and Kim - 2004 - Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms with a ne.pdf","","excluded; not recent","Genetic algorithms; Quantum computing; Quantum mechanics; Convergence; Evolutionary computation; Robustness; Optimization methods; Space exploration; Evolution (biology); Associate members","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Like other evolutionary algorithms, QEA is also characterized by the representation of the individual, evaluation function, and population dynamics. However, instead of binary, numeric, or symbolic representation, QEA uses a Q-bit, defined as the smallest unit of information, for the probabilistic representation and a Q-bit individual as a string of Q-bits. A Q-gate is introduced as a variation operator to drive the individuals toward better solutions.

This has motivated the creation of quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which successfully use some quantum physics principles to improve the performance of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) for classical computers. This paper proposes a novel QIEA (Quantum-Inspired Linear Genetic Programming - QILGP) for automatic synthesis of machine code (MC) programs and aims to present a preliminary evaluation of applying the quantum-inspiration paradigm to evolve programs by using two symbolic regression problems. QILGP performance is compared to AIMGP model, since it is the most successful genetic programming technique to evolve MC. In the first problem, the hit ratio of QILGP (100%) is greater than the one of AIMGP (77%). In the second problem, QILGP seems to carry on a less greedy search than AIMGP. Since QILGP presents some satisfactory results, this paper shows that the quantum-inspiration paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs more efficiently, which encourages further developments of that first and simplest QILGP model with multiple individuals.","2009-05-01","2022-04-24 22:34:02","2022-04-28 11:29:24","","1691-1698","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\9IZ8SLTR\Dias and Pacheco - 2009 - Toward a Quantum-Inspired Linear Genetic Programmi.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/221006977_Toward_a_Quantum-Inspired_Linear_Genetic_Programming_Model","excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quantum wave function can sometimes tunnel through significant obstacles. However it can also sometimes get stuck in local minima, even for fairly simple problems. An initial Hamiltonian which insufficiently mixes computational basis states is analogous to a poorly mixing Markov transition rule. We study a physical system -- the Ising quantum chain with alternating sector interaction defects, but constant transverse field -- which is equivalent to applying the quantum adiabatic algorithm to a particular SAT problem. We prove that for a constant range of values for the transverse field, the spectral gap is exponentially small in the sector length. Indeed, we prove that there are exponentially many eigenvalues all exponentially close to the ground state energy. Applying the adiabatic theorem therefore takes exponential time, even for this simple problem.","2004-06-13","2022-04-24 20:55:08","2022-04-28 11:29:24","2022-04-24","502–510","","","","","","","STOC '04","","","","Association for Computing Machinery","New York, NY, USA","","","","","","ACM Digital Library","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PKKQWVMX\Reichardt - 2004 - The quantum adiabatic optimization algorithm and l.pdf","","excluded; not recent","Ising quantum chain; quantum adiabatic optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Full geometry optimizations of the aforementioned species reveal non-existence of ionic minima on the explored 1:1 p-toluenesulfonic acid-water complex potential-energy hypersurfaces (PEHSs), implying that two or three p-toluenesulfonate ions (+crystal field) are required to stabilize the ionic H3O+C6H4(CH3)SO3- species found in the crystal structure of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate (in fact, oxonium p-toluenesulfonate). Harmonic vibrational analyses of the p-toluenesulfonic acid-water complex as well as of the p-toluenesulfonate anion were used to confirm some of our previous reassignments of bands in the vibrational spectra of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and several metal p-toluenesulfonates. According to the quantum chemical results, the symmetric SO3 bending mode should appear at higher frequencies than the antisymmetric one. A more consistent interpretation of the region of appearance of the SO3 stretching modes is proposed which is in excellent agreement with the experimental spectroscopic data. The frequency of the multireference benzenoid N14 (B2u) mode (the Kekule type vibration) is excellently predicted at the B3LYP level of theory, while the HF methodology performs significantly poorer in this respect. The interaction energies as well as the vibrational frequency shifts of the most relevant modes are also presented for the 1:1 p-toluenesulfonic acid-water complex. The NBO analysis is employed to analyze the charge transfer interaction within the complex.

After a short introduction to the requirements of the LHCb detector, this paper reviews the operational strategy during the first three years of data taking. The focus is on the detector performance together with a description of several fundamental system developments which emerged in this period and which allowed LHCb to venture well beyond its design parameters and to extend the physics program. With the inclusion of a solid charm physics program and electroweak and soft QCD measurements in the forward direction, LHCb has established itself as an excellent forward general purpose detector at the LHC. Running at twice the design luminosity, LHCb has been able to collect an integrated luminosity of more than 3 fb-! at an operational inefficiency of less than 4% in the first three years.","2012","2022-04-11 16:40:54","2022-04-27 15:45:23","","1479-86","","","","","","","2012 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference Record (NSS/MIC 2012)  Workshop on Room-Temperature Semiconductor X-Ray and Gamma-Ray Detectors","","","","IEEE","Piscataway, NJ, USA","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MZZEWZYS\Jacobsson - 2012 - Performance of the LHCb Detector During the LHC Pr.pdf","","excluded; not an application; reverse snowball; electroweak theories; flavour model; position sensitive particle detectors; quantum chromodynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This index can be applied to study carcinogenic substances identified in studies on humans or primates. This index is found to be significantly different between carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic chemicals tested on rhesus monkeys. An existing theory of how some chemicals cause damage to living cells is that free radicals can react with other molecules to cause cell damage or DNA mutation. A free radical is any atom or molecule that contains unpaired electrons. Historically, this meant its spin was not zero. In quantum mechanics each molecule under consideration can be thought of as a wave function from a Hilbert space. The Hilbert space of the wave function with odd half spin is shown not to be pairwise consistent. We have previously made the hypothesis that (the spaces of wave functions of) spin zero atoms or molecules are pairwise consistent. Now the lens space L(3, q) is also pairwise consistent if q is relatively prime to 3. Thus we reason that the latter may be a limit or generalization of the Hilbert space (of wave functions of the molecule under consideration). We have defined the above index based on a function that is sensitive to both spin parity and whether it is relatively prime to 3, the space dimensions. The index can be used to extend the theory of how chemicals may cause damage to living cells.

However, existing point mutation detection methods suffer from low sensitivity, specificity, and a tedious assay processes. In this report, an assay technology is proposed which combines the outstanding specificity of gap ligase chain reaction (Gap-LCR), the high sensitivity of single-molecule coincidence detection, and the superior optical properties of quantum dots (QDs) for multiplexed detection of point mutations in genomic DNA. Mutant-specific ligation products are generated by Gap-LCR and subsequently captured by QDs to form DNA-QD nanocomplexes that are detected by single-molecule spectroscopy (SMS) through multi-color fluorescence burst coincidence analysis, allowing for multiplexed mutation detection in a separation-free format. The proposed assay is capable of detecting zeptomoles of KRAS codon 12 mutation variants with near 100% specificity. Its high sensitivity allows direct detection of KRAS mutation in crude genomic DNA without PCR pre-amplification.","2013-04-08","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-27 15:31:08","","1096-105","","7","9","","Small","","Small (Germany)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Germany Publisher: Wiley-VCH","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\6YKPET9N\Yunke Song et al. - 2013 - Single Quantum Dot Analysis Enables Multiplexed Po.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/smll.201202242","operations research; fluorescence; biosensors; DNA; genetics; genomics; molecular biophysics; quantum dots; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Catastrophic events bring more damage to urban areas than rural places because of the high density of human population, property and the infrastructures. Geo-informatics is critical for all stages of disaster management including disaster prevention, preparedness, emergency decision making, disaster relief, rebuilding and recovery. It is critical for risk assessment of natural disasters. Since all hazard risk components are location-specific and vary spatially, accurate risk assessment relies on geo-informatics. Geo-informatics as the basis of decision-making information has proved to be critical and essential to natural, technological and manmade disaster risk assessments. Commercial sources of geo-informatics are usually expensive, especially for those developing countries and regions where living standards are low but natural disasters occur more frequently and cause large losses. The expense of geo-informatics acquisition, collection and production varies vastly with different update frequency, imagery quality, and the total amount of information carried. In contrast with commercial sources, free sources of geo-data and geo-software have limited comparable features. However, they have the flexibility to add new features by further development. Based on a current study of urban natural disaster risk assessment and vulnerability mapping which aims at improving community safety and resilience to natural hazards, this paper shares our experience on zero cost solutions of geo-informatics acquisition, collection, and semi-automatic production procedures by using free internet resources of Google Maps, Google Earth, and free and/or open source software including QGIS (Quantum GIS), GRASS, SAGA, Monteverdi, Sextante GIS and Orfeo Toolbox. In order to enrich attributes to meet the requirements of risk assessment, methods of combining the acquired geo-informatics with other formats of geo-data (e.g., Digital Elevation Model, raster layers, vector layers, and Microsoft Excel files) are introduced. The purpose of this paper is to share our experience on zero-cost geo-informatics acquisition, collection and production solutions with urban planning managers, emergency managers, risk researchers and people with similar concerns. The geo-informatics developed from this research forms a basis for disaster vulnerability measurement which is an important part for urban disaster risk assessment.

Among other ubiquitous long-time properties, this process exhibits aging: events counted initially in a time interval [0,t] statistically strongly differ from those observed at later times [ta,ta+t]. The versatility of renewal theory is owed to its abstract formulation. Renewals can be interpreted as steps of a random walk, switching events in two-state models, domain crossings of a random motion, etc. In complex, disordered media, processes with scale-free waiting times play a particularly prominent role. We set up a unified analytical foundation for such anomalous dynamics by discussing in detail the distribution of the aging renewal process. We analyze its half-discrete, half-continuous nature and study its aging time evolution. These results are readily used to discuss a scale-free anomalous diffusion process, the continuous-time random walk. By this, we not only shed light on the profound origins of its characteristic features, such as weak ergodicity breaking, along the way, we also add an extended discussion on aging effects. In particular, we find that the aging behavior of time and ensemble averages is conceptually very distinct, but their time scaling is identical at high ages. Finally, we show how more complex motion models are readily constructed on the basis of aging renewal dynamics.Ticks on the financial market, people entering a concert hall, or microscopic particles diffusing across an osmotic membrane are all examples of stochastic events. If such events occurred independently from each other, the underlying processes would all correspond to so-called renewal processes. In the simplest case, the waiting times between two successive events would follow the Poisson distribution-well known from the decay of a radioactive material. In many cases, however, we encounter anomalous renewal processes with pronounced non-Poissonian distributions. Types of anomalous renewal processes that are particularly interesting are characterized by a power-law waiting-time distribution. Indeed, such processes show aging-the behavior of the system changes forever during its evolution-which is observed in a broad range of phenomena from the blinking of quantum dots to the motion of submicron particles in living biological cells. In this theoretical paper, we study these processes and answer the question of what effects a particular period of aging has on the process dynamics that follows it.Generally, a renewal process corresponds to the number of transitions in a system-the ticks of a Geiger counter or the jumps of a random walker. For the strongly disordered systems we have in mind, we show that the older the system in question, the slower its renewal process: The on-off blinking of quantum dots becomes less frequent, or the motion of a protein channel in a cell wall increasingly stalls. In a very old system, hardly any events occur. We present an integrated approach to the aging renewal theory with a careful discussion of hitherto neglected phenomena. Thus, we detail how, in an ensemble of particles, the population splits into a discrete fraction that does not show any renewals at all during a certain measurement period, and a fraction with a continuous distribution of renewals. Moreover, we show that aging effects show up differently in ensemble and time averages of the same physical observable and also that a physical interpretation is more straightforward using time averages of aging systems. Without knowledge of this subtle effect, one risks misinterpreting experimental or simulations data obtained by different measurements of the same process.Our theory can be applied to a wide range of systems, including those mentioned above. Because of its generic character, we also expect it to prove useful in finance and queuing theory, or in a wider context such as operations research, risk modeling, and social processes.","2014-01","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-27 14:31:56","","011028 (24 pp.)","","1","4","","Physical Review X","","Phys.

To this end, we transform modify QUBO from its conventional Boolean presentation into a spin glass with a random external field on each site. These fields tend to be rather large compared to the typical coupling, presenting EO with a challenging two-scale problem, exploring smaller differences in couplings effectively while sufficiently aligning with those strong external fields. However, we also find a simple solution to that problem that indicates that those external fields apparently tilt the energy landscape to a such a degree such that global minima become more easy to find than those of spin glasses without (or very small) fields. We explore the impact of the weight distribution of the QUBO formulation in the operations research literature and analyze their meaning in a spin-glass language. This is significant because QUBO problems are considered among the main contenders for NP-hard problems that could be solved efficiently on a quantum computer such as D-Wave.  2015 Published by Elsevier B.V.","2015","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-27 13:50:00","","16-19","","","68","","","","Physics Procedia","","","","Elsevier B.V.","Athens, GA, United states","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\3EB7RC4Z\Boettcher - 2015 - Extremal Optimization for Quadratic Unconstrained .pdf; ; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phpro.2015.07.102; http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.phpro.2015.07.102","Operations research; optimisation; quantum computing; Global optimization; Quantum computers; Combinatorial optimization; Condensed matter physics; Glass; NP-hard; Spin glass; excluded; Combinatorial Optimization; Extremal Optimization; Heuristics; not an application; Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization; Spin Glasses; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rangelands, accounting for about 81% of Australian land area, represent considerable carbon storage potential. Efficient modelling techniques to evaluate the potential for rangeland SOC stocks are vitally important in the assessment for the global carbon cycle and quantum abatement. This study aimed to evaluate boosted regression trees (BRT) and random forest (RF) in predicting SOC stocks from ground measured and remotely-sensed variables using two feature selection techniques to identify the dominant variables that affect SOC stocks in the rangelands. Using field-based measurement of SOC stock collected from 564 sites across the study area and 28 of GIS-based environmental variables including climate, topography, radiometry, vegetation and land fractional cover data, we employed stepwise regression (SR, linear approach) and genetic algorithm (GA, nonlinear approach) to select the most informative variables. These selected predictors were then used to train the BRT and RF models. In all, four models were evaluated; BRT using stepwise selection of predictors (SR_BRT); RF using stepwise (SR_RF); BRT using GA selection of predictors (GA_BRT) and RF using GA (GA_RF). In addition, BRT using all predictors (All_BRT) and the RF using all predictors (All_RF) were used as benchmarks to test the performance of the four models. Of the field-based data, 75% was used to train the model (""calibration dataset"") and the remaining 25% was used to validate the prediction of SOC stocks (""validation dataset""). The results indicate that the RF exhibited a better performance in predicting SOC stocks than the BRT regardless of input variables. The two models explained ~45% of the total SOC stocks. In addition, we verified that feature selection for both machine learning techniques is necessary for estimating SOC stocks, even though BRT was relatively insensitive to the input features selected by SR. The GA_RF was the most promising model with reliable predictors to predict SOC stocks, with the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) and the highest R2 values (7.44 Mg C ha-1 and 0.48, respectively), suggesting that the proposed methodology may provide a cost effective method to predict SOC stocks in the rangelands. The important variables for explaining the observed SOC stocks were rainfall, elevation, prescott index (PI), and land fractional cover (bare ground fraction).  2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

However, the new context brings out new opportunities at descriptive, predictive and prescriptive levels for supply chain network design, logistics and distribution and strategic sourcing. The key question is still how to capture and to use information. One striking example can be taken from social media, where their use allow to gain insight into the perception of consumers and to capture a real time overview of consumer reactions, regarding one or more specific events. In this regard, different modern approaches, such as IoT or Quantum neural network, are developed. In the same line of thought, we propose an analytic approach, based on KNN, Logistic Regression and SVM with the use of Twitter data in chicken supply chain management. Results identify the main concerns related to chicken products and allow to the development of a consumer-centric supply chain.

This technological limitation has generated considerable interest, motivating efforts to design efficient and adroit minor-embedding procedures that bypass sparsity constraints. In this paper, starting from a previous equational formulation by Dridi et al. (arXiv:1810.01440), we propose integer programming (IP) techniques for solving the minor-embedding problem. The first approach involves a direct translation from the previous equational formulation to IP, while the second decomposes the problem into an assignment master problem and fiber condition checking subproblems. The proposed methods are able to detect instance infeasibility and provide bounds on solution quality, capabilities not offered by currently employed heuristic methods. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methods with an extensive computational assessment involving three families of random graphs of varying sizes and densities. The direct translation as a monolithic IP model can be solved with existing commercial solvers yielding valid minor-embeddings but it is outperformed, overall, by the decomposition approach. Our results demonstrate the promise of our methods for the studied benchmarks, highlighting the advantages of using IP technology for minor-embedding problems.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-26 14:18:58","","112-129","","","12296 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Vienna, Austria","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\YPTNZMF7\Bernal et al. - 2020 - Integer Programming Techniques for Minor-Embedding.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58942-4_8","Heuristic methods; Operations research; Artificial intelligence; Integer programming; Computer programming; Constraint theory; Embeddings; Graph theory; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we focus on constrained clustering, a semi-supervised learning task that involves using limited amounts of labelled data, formulated as constraints, to improve clustering accuracy. We present an Ising modeling framework that is flexible enough to support various types of constraints and we instantiate the framework with two common types of constraints: pairwise instance-level and partition-level. We study the proposed framework, both theoretically and empirically, and demonstrate how constrained clustering problems can be solved on a specialized CMOS annealer. Empirical evaluation across eight benchmark sets shows that our framework outperforms the state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms and that, unlike those algorithms, it can solve problems that involve combinations of constraint types. We also show that our framework provides high quality solutions orders of magnitudes more quickly than a recent constraint programming approach, making it suitable for mainstream data mining tasks.  2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","2020","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-26 14:14:09","","130-147","","","12296 LNCS","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","","","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","Vienna, Austria","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PN299JE8\Cohen et al. - 2020 - An Ising Framework for Constrained Clustering on S.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-58942-4_9","Operations research; Heuristic algorithms; Quantum computers; Combinatorial optimization; Computer programming; Computer hardware; Constraint theory; Ising model; Data mining; Semi-supervised learning; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is believed that they are quantum computer resistant. The compact ciphertext size of ECC and AES makes them the best choice for cloud computing, sensor networks or small devices where we want resource-saving without compromising the security of the system. But the main issue with AES is key sharing, which is dependent on the secured channel and if that channel gets compromised the communication will also get compromised. To overcome this issue, we are proposing the novel concept, which is generating keys for both AES and ECC using the proposed methodology given in the paper. The algorithm does not need a secured channel at any level as it is inheriting properties of the ECDH algorithm and adding novel concepts with it for key generation. We have observed from the experimental results that our proposed algorithm generates 16-byte key which is inheriting ECC property, so it can with stand with prime factorization attack and QC. The other property is that the key generation algorithm is lesser complex as compared to the existing related algorithms.  2020, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-26 14:08:49","","962-971","","5","11","","International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\Y4YCRR8M\Farooq and Chawla - 2020 - A novel approach of asymmetric key generation in s.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-020-01029-z","Quantum computers; Cryptography; Sensor networks; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Ethical decision-making is a unique aspect of such socio-cognitive systems. In situations that require deliberation over a multitude of options with ethical implications, moral dilemmas are often resolved by a range of heuristics and principles that view the situation from different perspectives. While constraint and utility-driven decision-making strategies are customary in agent-based models, the incompatibility among multiple perspectives can invalidate the underlying premises of models of probabilistic utility-based decisions that rely on classic Kolmogorov axioms. In this paper, we highlight the fallacies of such models and present a practical case study to demonstrate how quantum cognition models can provide an alternative and credible representation of decision-making behaviour in simulations that involve ethical dilemmas.  2019,  Operational Research Society 2019.","2020","2022-04-11 16:40:51","2022-04-26 13:50:51","","98-106","","2","14","","Journal of Simulation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Taylor and Francis Ltd.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>","; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PGXVGFAN\Yilmaz - 2020 - A quantum cognition model for simulating ethical d.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/17477778.2019.1603090","Behavioral research; Decision making; Cognitive systems; Computational complexity; Autonomous agents; Computational methods; Multi agent systems; Philosophical aspects; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Usually, when evaluating and comparing the performance of current controllers, various figures of merit (FMs) are used, e.g., the mean squared error or the absolute error between the reference and the measurement. Here, it is shown that such FMs have a random nature. Nevertheless, only one result is reported in many published articles, for each FMs. Also, it is not indicated whether or not more than one trial has been performed to obtain the FM. In that case, opposite conclusions can be reached when two current controllers are compared, depending on the chosen results. In this sense, the number, $n$ , of experimental runs required to accurately compare any FM, is proposed in order to address this problem. Likewise, a statistical comparison procedure is introduced to evaluate the relative performance of two controllers using any FM. Also, based on the proposed statistical comparison methodology compared to other criteria, an exhaustive simulation analysis is presented comparing the accuracy of decision-making. Finally, a real data set application based on experimental results is used to illustrate the proposed procedure.","2021","2022-04-11 16:15:52","2022-04-25 13:50:32","","1-11","","","70","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TBSC6HQS\9373349.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4UBB879X\Rivas-Martínez et al. - 2021 - Statistical Tools to Evaluate the Performance of C.pdf","","excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","Current measurement; Central limit theorem (CLT); Current control; current controller performance; hypothesis test; interval estimation; Power conversion; power converters and drives; Random variables","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach necessitates the rigorous derivation of performance criteria to serve as objective functions and undergo vector optimization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approach by applying it to a specific Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) simulation, with multiple stochastic quality measures. We formulate performance criteria of this use-case, pose an optimization problem, and solve it by means of a simulation-based Pareto approach.

As sound as the comparison-based approach may seem, serious epistemological and methodological qualifications have been made concerning the foundations of the concept, its applicability, and its dependence from the chosen philosophical perspective. The article reviews and reassesses technical and philosophical arguments on the limits of empirical validation with respect to social simulation. The paper is intended to reposition empirical validation for social simulations that are theory-free and non-predictive. The proposed shift is inspired by the recent critical reassessment of significance tests in applied statistics. According to this shift, it is transparency which becomes paramount for the single social simulation project, whereas empirical validation on the macro level is crucial only after meta-analysis of rival simulation models has shown robust findings despite different sets of assumptions.","2015-12","2022-04-11 15:14:32","2022-04-24 23:38:43","","4069-4080","","","","","","Limits of empirical validation","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1558-4305","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CVEEV7QG\7408560.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TV9VRTJ5\Hofmann - 2015 - Limits of empirical validation A review of argume.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study; not an application; reverse snowball","Calibration; Data models; Mathematical model; Adaptation models; Computational modeling; Predictive models; Numerical models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2015 Winter Simulation Conference (WSC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This is a natural SDP generalization of the well-studied positive LP problem. Although positive LPs can be solved in polylogarithmic depth while using only $\tilde{O}(\log^{2} n/\varepsilon^2)$ parallelizable iterations, the best known positive SDP solvers due to Jain and Yao require $O(\log^{14} n /\varepsilon^{13})$ parallelizable iterations. Several alternative solvers have been proposed to reduce the exponents in the number of iterations. However, the correctness of the convergence analyses in these works has been called into question, as they both rely on algebraic monotonicity properties that do not generalize to matrix algebra. In this paper, we propose a very simple algorithm based on the optimization framework proposed for LP solvers. Our algorithm only needs $\tilde{O}(\log^2 n / \varepsilon^2)$ iterations, matching that of the best LP solver.

Doing so illuminates systemic properties of weakly predictive simulations, including their ability to produce plausible responses.

However, currently proposed diversification approaches have not put much attention on practical usability in large-scale settings, such as modern web search systems. In this work, we make two contributions toward this goal. First, we propose a combination of optimizations and heuristics for an implicit diversification algorithm based on the desirable facility placement principle, and present two algorithms that achieve linear complexity without compromising the retrieval effectiveness. Instead of an exhaustive comparison of documents, these algorithms first perform a clustering phase and then exploit its outcome to compose the diverse result set. Second, we describe and analyze two variants for distributed diversification in a computing cluster, for large-scale IR where the document collection is too large to keep in one node. Our contribution in this direction is pioneering, as there exists no earlier work in the literature that investigates the effectiveness and efficiency of diversification on a distributed setup. Extensive evaluations on a standard TREC framework demonstrate a competitive retrieval quality of the proposed optimizations to the baseline algorithm while reducing the processing time by more than 80% and up to 97%, and shed light on the efficiency and effectiveness tradeoffs of diversification when applied on top of a distributed architecture.","2016-08-29","2022-04-11 15:14:32","2022-04-24 23:22:07","2022-04-24 23:21:22","1-30","","3","10","","ACM Trans.

Given a set of ranked results for a set of objects (e.g., web documents, facilities, etc.) with a distance between any pair, the goal is to select a subset               S               satisfying the following three criteria: (a) the subset               S               satisfies some constraint (e.g., bounded cardinality), (b) the subset contains results of high “quality,” and (c) the subset contains results that are “diverse” relative to the distance measure. The goal of result diversification is to produce a diversified subset while maintaining high quality as much as possible. We study a broad class of problems where the distances are a metric, where the constraint is given by independence in a matroid, where quality is determined by a monotone submodular function and diversity is defined as the sum of distances between objects in               S               . Our problem is a generalization of the               max-sum diversification               problem studied in Gollapudi and Sharma [2009], which in turn is a generalization of the               max-sum p-dispersion problem               studied extensively in location theory. It is NP-hard even with the triangle inequality.

However, in these domains, data collected about adversarial actions are remarkably imperfect, where reported negative instances of crime may be mislabeled or uncertain. Unfortunately, past attempts to develop predictive and prescriptive models to address this problem suffer from shortcomings from a modeling perspective as well as in the implementability of their techniques. Most notably these models i) neglect the uncertainty in crime data, leading to inaccurate and biased predictions of adversary behavior, ii) use coarse-grained crime analysis and iii) do not provide a convincing evaluation as they only look at a single protected area. Additionally, they iv) proposed time-consuming techniques which cannot be directly integrated into low resource outposts. In this innovative application paper, we (I) introduce iWare-E a novel imperfect-observation aWare Ensemble (iWare-E) technique1, which is designed to handle the uncertainty in crime information efficiently. This approach leads to superior accuracy for adversary behavior prediction (up to 34% increase in AUC) compared to the previous state-of-the-art. We also demonstrate the country-wide efficiency of the models and are the first to (II) evaluate our adversary behavioral model across different protected areas in Uganda, i.e., Murchison Fall and Queen Elizabeth National Park, (totaling about 7500 square km) as well as (III) on fine-grained temporal resolutions. Lastly, (IV) we provide a scalable planning algorithm to design fine-grained patrol routes for the rangers, which achieves up to 150% improvement in number of predicted attacks detected.","2018","2022-04-11 15:14:32","2022-04-24 22:47:52","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\R3MZXSU5\Gholami et al. - 2018 - Adversary Models Account for Imperfect Crime Data.pdf","","predictive models, wildlife poaching, wildlife protection, patrol planning, ensemble techniques, field test evaluation; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball; ensemble techniques, field test evaluation, patrol planning, predictive models, wildlife poaching, wildlife protection","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When the cost function has many local minima, the deterministic algorithms become easily trapped in suboptimal solutions. The simulated annealing method tries to overcome this difficulty by introducing thermal noise in the problem. Here the author explores the possibility of implementing search procedures analogous to the quantum tunneling effect. The suggested dynamics is a guided diffusion process of an interacting population of configurations. Different dynamical aspects of the search process are formulated first in a simple one-dimensional tight-binding model with a hierarchical potential. The new algorithm is then applied to the Traveling Salesman Problem. It is demonstrated that the use of interacting, evolving populations of tours representing the authors `wave packet' leads to systematic improvements and possibly, to the optimal tour. In addition, the structure of the cost function landscape for a given instance becomes locally accessible. The performance of the algorithm and its implications for parallel computing and `genetic' programming are briefly discussed.","1988","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","391-416","","3","73","","Zeitschrift fur Physik B (Condensed Matter)","","Z.

Part 2 (of 2), July 28, 1996 - August 2, 1996","","","","","Radiant burner modeling can help clarify issues related to burner development, design and performance. This paper describes a one-dimensional model that simulates bilayered reticulated ceramic radiant burner operation. We represent combustion in a porous medium with a model that includes multistep chemistry, radiative heat transfer in the porous medium, and separate gas and solid energy equations. Species predictions show that almost all of the methane is consumed within the porous medium, the concentration peaks of most radicals are inside the porous medium, and nearly all of the NO is formed in the porous medium. As part of a program to develop a comprehensive radiant burner model, temperature measurements are made above a reticulated ceramic radiant burner. Uncoated fine-wire thermocouples are used to measure gas temperature. A radiation correction that includes radiant flux from the burner is used to adjust the thermocouple measurements. Corrections of 200-300 K are calculated, owing to a relatively large bead (460 m) and high bead emissivity. OH laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and laser absorption are also used to determine the gas temperature. The LIF-determined temperatures are corrected for trapping, partial rotational relaxation, and rotational-dependent quantum yields. OH-LIF temperature measurements are slightly higher than thermocouple measurements. Compared to experimental results, the model overpredicts the gas temperature above the burner. Several factors could account for the deviation, including uncertainty in the porous medium properties and the possibility that the chemistry is affected by the solid surface in the porous medium.","1996","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","1755-1762","","","1","","","","Symposium (International) on Combustion","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :66</p>; <p>Cited By :66</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","","","Operations research; Combustion; Computer simulation; Equations of state; Fuel burners; Gas fuels; Heat transfer; Porous materials; Temperature; Temperature measurement; excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The lasers have reduced the output-beam divergence in a simple structure which does not contain an additional spot-size transformer. To improve high-temperature characteristics, we have investigated the influence of the thickness of separate-confinement-heterostructure layers and the number of quantum wells (QW's) on the threshold current and the output-beam divergence at high temperature. As a result, the fabricated lasers show low-threshold current (18 mA) and high-slope efficiency (0.4 mW/mA) with narrow output-beam divergence (12) at 85C. Moreover, we have obtained maximum coupling efficiency of -4.7 dB in a direct coupling to a SMF, and the reliability of longer than 105 h (MTTF) by a lifetime test of over 2000 h at 85C.","1997","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","1399-1404","","6","3","","IEEE Journal on Selected Topics in Quantum Electronics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE","<p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/2944.658794","Operations research; Performance; High temperature effects; Optical communication; Optical fiber coupling; Quantum well lasers; Semiconducting indium; excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To illustrate how to apply the methodology, a regression metamodel is developed for a client-server computer system. In particular, we studied hot the response time is affected by the quantum interval, the buffer size, and the total number of terminals when different queuing are employed in the operation of the round-robin queue with a limited buffer.

As might be expected from the granular structure of the MSP, the relative variation in pulse gain dG/G was found to decrease with scale size, falling from  12% when averaged over 0.18 mm areas to  7% for 1 mm square cells. The efficiency of the Al-coated MSP to 2540 A radiation was one order of magnitude higher than that of the bare plate.

In this work, we demonstrate the importance of using a finite applied bias slew rate (as opposed to instantaneous switching) to better approximate experimental device conditions, and thus to produce more accurate transient Wigner function simulation results. We show that the use of instantaneous (and thus unphysical) switching can significantly impact simulation results and lead to incorrect conclusions about device operation. We also find that slewed switching can reduce the high computational demands of transient simulations. The resonant tunneling diode (RTD) is used as a test device, and simulation results are produced with SQUADS (Stanford QUAntum Device Simulator).","1997","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","733-737","","5","44","","IEEE Transactions on Electron Devices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: IEEE","<p>Cited By :30</p>; <p>Cited By :30</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/16.568033","Operations research; Computer simulation; Quantum theory; Resonance; Switching functions; Transients; Tunnel diodes; excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The application of this methodology on an annual basis requires the assessment of research attitudes and behaviour, areas that have assumed considerable importance within universities around the world in the last decade. This increasing importance associated with research stems in part (a significant part) from the linkage of research quantum (output) of universities to their funding from the government. The methodology developed in this paper embraces a wide range of OR-type techniques as well as a range of change management tools from human resource management. These two sets of techniques and tools work together as tools in their own right as well as provide the infrastructure to achieve the objectives. The developed methodology is an interesting blend of hard techniques and 'soft' approaches implemented through a soft heuristic; indeed this application is an example of mixed-mode modelling. The OR techniques (conventional in both their nature and application) are comprised of social judgement theory (for bench-marking research attitudes) and integer linear programming (for setting research targets). The results of the application of the developed methodology are discussed in terms of the effect on research quantum over a five-year period. A similar methodology could be developed for a change process covering aspects of an organization other than research output in a number of countries.","2004-05","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","440-52","","5","55","","Journal of the Operational Research Society","","J.

However, the term is ill-defined, and it is difficult to justify such claims within a legal process. This paper demonstrates a well-developed approach, which is a logical, transparent, auditable and sustainable means of presenting such a claim. It describes the format for a claim document that presents first the disruptive triggers, then using a formal qualitative model builds the case from the interacting effects of these triggers. Transformation of this model into a computer simulation and the ability to explore different scenarios provides the quantitative part of the claim document. Thus three elements are presented in the document: demonstration of causality, of responsibility and of a quantum for the claim. This process also provides additional benefits, including a high level of participant ""buy-in"", and the basis of a model that can be used to support the claim.  2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

Paired-cell Overlapping Loops of Cards with Authorisation (POLCA) is a quick response manufacturing strategy designed with these situations in mind. POLCA is a hybrid push-pull strategy that combines the best features of card-based pull systems and push systems. At the same time POLCA gets around the limitations of pull systems in high variety or custom product environments. In partnership with its member companies, the Center for Quick Response Manufacturing (QRM) has recently implemented POLCA at several factories in the US and Canada. In this article, we first give an overview of the POLCA system, explain how it works and provide qualitative comparisons with pull/Kanban systems. Then, we present a step-wise procedure for implementing POLCA in a factory. Using examples from the implementation of POLCA at several factories, we address several practical issues such as computing the number of POLCA cards, determining the quantum of work a POLCA card represents, and addressing part shortages. We also discuss the different performance improvements that have resulted from these implementations including reductions in lead-time, increase in percentage of on-time deliveries and employee satisfaction.","2009","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-04-11 16:55:34","","596-610","","7","20","","Production Planning and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Taylor and Francis Ltd.","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>","","http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09537280903034297","Operations research; Computer applications; Industrial engineering; Manufacture; excluded; not recent","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2020","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-05-04 11:23:12","","385-399","","2","11","","International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TY5WT3EX\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w","Sensitivity analysis; Defects; Inventory control; Numerical methods; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); included; forward snowball; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Because energy storage can improve the utilization rate of renewable energy, this paper establishes a storage capacity expansion planning model considering multiple functions of hybrid energy storage in the RIES. In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed. Rain flow counting method is used to research the life of hybrid energy storage system, which improves the accuracy of energy storage annual cost calculation. In the Simulation and Analysis section, the genetic quantum algorithm is used for simulation and analysis of the role and benefits of hybrid energy storage.

In this paper, a multi-element hybrid energy storage system (MHESS) is built to smooth fluctuations of renewable energy and user demand. A bi-level capacity configuration model is established to reduce the investment cost of energy storage applications in RIES. Based on the proposed active energy storage strategy, the day-ahead model formulated the optimal power output on the hour-level scale for energy supply equipment and gave the target power of MHESS for the sub-layer model. On this basis, the day-in planning model took into account the power response characteristics of MHESS to smooth the renewable energy fluctuations on the minute-level scale. The Empirical Mode Decomposition algorithm was used to decompose the target power of MHESS to obtain the optimal capacity configuration and power output of each energy storage unit. According to the cases study, the proposed method reduces the investment cost by 12.9% compared with the passive mode. Besides, it reduced the investment cost by 104.3%, compared with the simple Li-ion battery method.

Fuzzy logic and particle swarm optimization are the two very popular soft computing methods which have used for feature selection. In this paper different variants of PSO are summarized to explore the latest development in PSO. The survey has been grouped in three categories; structures based PSO variants, fuzzy logic-PSO hybrids and parallel PSO variants. On the basis of findings of survey, map reduce two phases quantum behaved fuzzy rule PSO (MR-TP-QFPSO) method has been proposed. Quantum is the smallest possible state of any matter. Therefore, in proposed method smallest state of any particle is trit, which is having three values 0, 1 and #. # is included to bring a state of uncertainty where, feature is considered neither accepted nor rejected. In first phase search, feature space is exhaustively explored. During exhaustive initial search (first phase), multiple subsets of features are selected using quantum behaved fuzzy rule PSO (QFPSO). From these multiple subsets, minimum most important features (lower bound features) and maximum range of selected features are selected (upper bound feature subset). In second phase, selected feature subspace (selected in first phase) has been exploited and finally merged with lower bound features. The entire two phases search is highly iterative and it is well known that map reduce frame work can accelerate any iterative task by parallel processing. Therefore, proposed two phases QFPSO (TP-QFPSO) is applied using map reduce (MR-TP-QFPSO). The analysis of proposed algorithm clearly shows that map reduce has decreased the processing time of serial TP-QFPSO algorithm. The MR-TP-QFPSO is compared with other feature selection methods. The results on bench marking datasets show that MR-TP-QFRPSO outperformed the other methods. The reduction in execution time is directly propositional to the number of cluster nodes used. Therefore, as number of nodes is increased execution time will decrease without affecting the performance.  2017, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.","2018","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-05-02 16:47:44","","888-900","","4","9","","International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Publisher: Springer","<p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VKNGCZSY\Agarwal and Ranjan - 2018 - MR-TP-QFPSO map reduce two phases quantum fuzzy P.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-017-0682-9","Quantum theory; Fuzzy rules; Feature extraction; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Surveys; Big data; Computer circuits; Fuzzy inference; Fuzzy logic; Iterative methods; Soft computing; excluded; not an application; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) approaches have been widely studied. In a MAGDM problem, the multiple DMs are usually regarded as independent. However, in many practical situations, the opinions from different DMs are likely to influence each other or to be affected by the environment. To address it, a quantum framework based on quantum probability theory is proposed in this paper. The goal is to model the subjectivity in MAGDM when we have subjective beliefs towards DMs’ independence or relations. The modeled subjectivity sources from the interference of beliefs. However, in classical models, subjectivity usually comes from the preference of DMs when determining weights or giving an evaluation towards alternatives. In this paper, the classical MAGDM technics are used to do the preparation firstly. Then a Bayesian network is constructed and it is extended to a quantum framework. The beliefs toward DMs are in a superposition. Namely, the opinions of DMs are viewed as various wave functions that are occurring at the same time. Then the beliefs will interfere with each and influence the final result. When all the DMs are deemed independent, the quantum framework will degenerate into a classical Bayesian network. The various cases of a simple example have been discussed and analyzed. A real supplier section problem is also used to illustrate and validate our model. Finally, an overall comparative analysis regarding the subjectivity in MAGDM is performed.","2018-10-01","2022-04-25 19:23:54","2022-05-02 16:47:26","2022-04-25 19:23:54","560-572","","","124","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DFBS88UQ\He et al. - 2018 - A quantum framework for modelling subjectivity in .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4VXTI5P8\S0360835218303735.html","","excluded; not an application","Independence of decision maker; Multi-attribute group decision making; Quantum framework; Subjectivity","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Knapsack problem (KP) is often used in many areas, such as business, combinatorial mathematics, computational complexity theory, cryptography and applied mathematics. Based on the characteristics of 0-1 knapsack problem, this essay proposes an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (IQEA) based on dynamic rotation angle catastrophe technology and designs a quantum rotating gate operator which adaptively adjusts the values of rotation angle according to the fitness value and evolution generations. In the process of evolution, the early quantum rotation angle is used to carry out the catastrophic operation of some individuals. The individual and the individual after the catastrophe are evolved in parallel, and the multipath optimization is carried out to improve the parallelism of the algorithm. This can effectively make the population jump out of the current optimal solution, increase the diversity of the population, carry out multi direction search, and maintain the stability of the population, and ensure that the excellent information in the subpopulation will not be lost. The experimental results of the typical knapsack problem show that the performance of the algorithm is better than the traditional evolutionary algorithm and the traditional quantum evolutionary algorithm in solving the knapsack problem.

The selected belief is usually regarded as a decision while the agent that performs the decision-making process is called as a decision-maker. The decision-making process that makes use of multiple attribute cue pattern as well as multiple decision makers to select a belief is called as multi-attribute and multi-agent decision making. This research proposes quantum inspired approach to multi-attribute and multi-agent decision making process considering the ability of quantum theories to model several complex human cognitive processes as reported in the literature. The main contributions of this work are: a) quantum object based encoding of multi-attribute cue pattern b) ensemble based representation of multi-agent decision making. Further, an analogy between proposed work and double slit experiment to illustrate the interference effect in decision making is also presented. The novelty of this work lies in: a) proposing a quantum inspired ensemble approach to model multi-attribute and multi-agent decision making b) the proposed work outperforms the quantum approach as well as ensemble approach to the decision making with Pima Indiana Diabetes (PID) dataset.

Absence of contextuality in the representational theories that are used for modelling cognitive processes results in inconsistencies between expected and actual decisions. These inconsistencies are usually regarded as paradoxes. However, recent literature reports that the quantum formalism is successful in explaining these paradoxes. In this article, we show the remarkable connection between contextuality, cognitive paradoxes and quantum formalism with a focus on decision-making. In this regard, we first analyse the paradoxes of human cognition from contextuality perspective as they share the pattern of local consistency and global inconsistency. This analysis is carried out using the proposed two-step contextuality analysis framework using the theories such as contextuality-by-Default and State Context Property formalism. Subsequently, this analysis provides an understanding on the dynamics of thoughts that has led to the paradoxical decisions which varies from the theoretical decisions. On the other hand, the success of quantum approach to cognitive paradoxes is due to their support for contextuality which is facilitated by the natural quantum characteristics. In this regard, we also narrate on how natural quantum characteristics facilitate contextuality with an example on decision-making. As a result, this article brings out the importance of contextuality in cognitive paradoxes and quantum formalism. Inferences obtained from this analysis emphasize on how and why quantum formalism is suitable for cognitive paradoxes.

In this paper, we present a feature selection method based on hybrid improved quantum-behavior particle swarm optimization, called HI-BQPSO. The HI-BQPSO combines a filtering method with an improved quantum-behavior particle swarm optimization algorithm to greatly reduce the dimensionality of the data so as to overcome some of the shortcomings of BQPSO. Tests were conducted on nine gene expression datasets and 36 UCI datasets to evaluate and compare the classification accuracy of the HI-BQPSO's selected feature subsets against four other algorithms.

Recently Brand\~ao et al. improved the quantum SDP-solver in the so-called quantum state input model, where the input matrices of the SDP are given as purified mixed states. They also gave the first non-trivial application of quantum SDP-solving by obtaining a more efficient algorithm for the problem of shadow tomography (proposed by Aaronson in 2017). In this paper we improve on all previous quantum SDP-solvers. Mainly we construct better Gibbs-samplers for both input models, which directly gives better bounds for SDP-solving. For an SDP with $m$ constraints involving $n\times n$ matrices, our improvements yield an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left( \left( \sqrt{m} + \sqrt{n}\gamma \right)s \gamma^4\right)$ upper bound on SDP-solving in the sparse matrix input model and an $\widetilde{\mathcal O}\left( \left(\sqrt{m}+B^{2.5}\gamma^{3.5} \right)B\gamma^4 \right)$ upper bound in the quantum state input model. We then apply these results to the problem of shadow tomography to simultaneously improve the best known upper bounds on sample complexity due to Aaronson and complexity due Brandao et al. Furthermore, we apply our quantum SDP-solvers to the problems of quantum state discrimination and E-optimal design. In both cases we beat the classical lower bound in terms of some parameters, at the expense of heavy dependence on some other parameters. Finally we prove two lowers bounds for solving SDPs using quantum algorithms: (1) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}B/\eps)$ in the quantum state input model, and (2) $\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{m}\alpha/\eps)$ in the quantum operator input model. These lower bounds show that the $\sqrt{m}$ factor and the polynomial dependence on the parameters $B,\alpha$, and $1/\eps$ are necessary.","2019","2022-04-24 21:22:33","2022-05-02 16:02:26","2022-04-24 21:22:33","15 pages","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1804.05058","Comment: 36 pages","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2QQVTTJ2\van Apeldoorn and Gilyén - 2019 - Improvements in Quantum SDP-Solving with Applicati.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ADHPGBKX\1804.html","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We consider SDP instances with $m$ constraint matrices, each of dimension $n$, rank at most $r$, and sparsity $s$. The first algorithm assumes access to an oracle to the matrices at unit cost. We show that it has run time $\tilde{O}(s^2(\sqrt{m}\epsilon^{-10}+\sqrt{n}\epsilon^{-12}))$, with $\epsilon$ the error of the solution. This gives an optimal dependence in terms of $m, n$ and quadratic improvement over previous quantum algorithms when $m\approx n$. The second algorithm assumes a fully quantum input model in which the matrices are given as quantum states. We show that its run time is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{m}+\text{poly}(r))\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log n,B,\epsilon^{-1})$, with $B$ an upper bound on the trace-norm of all input matrices. In particular the complexity depends only poly-logarithmically in $n$ and polynomially in $r$. We apply the second SDP solver to learn a good description of a quantum state with respect to a set of measurements: Given $m$ measurements and a supply of copies of an unknown state $\rho$ with rank at most $r$, we show we can find in time $\sqrt{m}\cdot\text{poly}(\log m,\log n,r,\epsilon^{-1})$ a description of the state as a quantum circuit preparing a density matrix which has the same expectation values as $\rho$ on the $m$ measurements, up to error $\epsilon$. The density matrix obtained is an approximation to the maximum entropy state consistent with the measurement data considered in Jaynes' principle from statistical mechanics. As in previous work, we obtain our algorithm by ""quantizing"" classical SDP solvers based on the matrix multiplicative weight method.

Existing approaches generally utilize a combination of multimodal features in a somehow heuristic way. However, how to employ and combine multiple information from different sources effectively is still an important yet largely unsolved problem. To address the problem, in this paper, we propose a Quantum-inspired Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (QMSA) framework. The framework consists of a Quantum-inspired Multimodal Representation (QMR) model (which aims to fill the “semantic gap” and model the correlations between different modalities via density matrix), and a Multimodal decision Fusion strategy inspired by Quantum Interference (QIMF) in the double-slit experiment (in which the sentiment label is analogous to a photon, and the data modalities are analogous to slits).

Farhi et al., arXiv:1411.4028; arXiv:1412.6062; arXiv:1602.07674). A level-p QAOA circuit consists of p steps; in each step a classical Hamiltonian, derived from the cost function, is applied followed by a mixing Hamiltonian. The 2p times for which these two Hamiltonians are applied are the parameters of the algorithm, which are to be optimized classically for the best performance. As p increases, parameter optimization becomes inefficient due to the curse of dimensionality. The success of the QAOA approach will depend, in part, on finding effective parameter-setting strategies. Here we analytically and numerically study parameter setting for the QAOA applied to MaxCut. For the level-1 QAOA, we derive an analytical expression for a general graph. In principle, expressions for higher p could be derived, but the number of terms quickly becomes prohibitive. For a special case of MaxCut, the “ring of disagrees,” or the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic ring, we provide an analysis for an arbitrarily high level. Using a fermionic representation, the evolution of the system under the QAOA translates into quantum control of an ensemble of independent spins. This treatment enables us to obtain analytical expressions for the performance of the QAOA for any p. It also greatly simplifies the numerical search for the optimal values of the parameters. By exploring symmetries, we identify a lower-dimensional submanifold of interest; the search effort can be accordingly reduced. This analysis also explains an observed symmetry in the optimal parameter values. Further, we numerically investigate the parameter landscape and show that it is a simple one in the sense of having no local optima.","2018-02-05","2022-04-25 14:22:49","2022-05-02 10:27:31","2022-04-25 14:22:49","022304","","2","97","","Phys.

Many clustering algorithms work by approximating the minimization of an objective function, namely the sum of within-the-cluster distances between points. The straightforward approach involves examining all the possible assignments of points to each of the clusters. This approach guarantees the solution will be a global minimum; however, the number of possible assignments scales quickly with the number of data points and becomes computationally intractable even for very small datasets. In order to circumvent this issue, cost function minima are found using popular local search-based heuristic approaches such as k-means and hierarchical clustering. Due to their greedy nature, such techniques do not guarantee that a global minimum will be found and can lead to sub-optimal clustering assignments. Other classes of global search-based techniques, such as simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms, may offer better quality results but can be too timeconsuming to implement. In this work, we describe how quantum annealing can be used to carry out clustering. We map the clustering objective to a quadratic binary optimization problem and discuss two clustering algorithms which are then implemented on commercially available quantum annealing hardware, as well as on a purely classical solver “qbsolv.” The ﬁrst algorithm assigns N data points to K clusters, and the second one can be used to perform binary clustering in a hierarchical manner.

In this work, we explore graph partitioning using quantum annealing on the D-Wave 2X machine. Motivated by a recently proposed graph-based electronic structure theory applied to quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) simulations, graph partitioning is used for reducing the calculation of the density matrix into smaller subsystems rendering the calculation more computationally efﬁcient. Unconstrained graph partitioning as community clustering based on the modularity metric can be naturally mapped into the Hamiltonian of the quantum annealer. On the other hand, when constraints are imposed for partitioning into equal parts and minimizing the number of cut edges between parts, a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) reformulation is required. This reformulation may employ the graph complement to ﬁt the problem in the Chimera graph of the quantum annealer. Partitioning into 2 parts and k parts concurrently for arbitrary k are demonstrated with benchmark graphs, random graphs, and small material system density matrix based graphs.

However, in order to extend quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization to multiobjective context, two major problems, namely the selection of personal and global best positions and the maintenance of population diversity, need to be taken into consideration. In this paper, a novel Cultural MOQPSO algorithm is proposed, in which cultural evolution mechanism is introduced into quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization to deal with multiobjective problems.

Moreover, to increase population diversity and obtain continuous and even-distributed Pareto fronts, a combination-based update operator is proposed to update the external population in this paper.

The applicability of such devices for many theoretical and real-world optimization problems, which are often constrained, is severely limited by the sparse, rigid layout of the devices’ quantum bits. Traditionally, constraints are addressed by the addition of penalty terms to the Hamiltonian of the problem, which, in turn, requires prohibitively increasing physical resources while also restricting the dynamical range of the interactions. Here, we propose a method for encoding constrained optimization problems on quantum annealers that eliminates the need for penalty terms and thereby reduces the number of required couplers and removes the need for minor embedding, greatly reducing the number of required physical qubits. We argue the advantages of the proposed technique and illustrate its effectiveness.

In particular, the implementation of constraints has become a major bottleneck in the embedding of practical problems, because the latter is typically achieved by adding harmful penalty terms to the problem Hamiltonian, a technique that often requires an all-to-all connectivity between the qubits. Recently, a novel technique designed to obviate the need for penalty terms was suggested; it is based on the construction of driver Hamiltonians that commute with the constraints of the problem, rendering the latter constants of motion. In this work we propose general guidelines for the construction of such driver Hamiltonians given an arbitrary set of constraints. We illustrate the broad applicability of our method by analyzing several diverse examples, namely, graph isomorphism, not-all-equal three-satisfiability, and the so-called Lechner-Hauke-Zoller constraints.

We propose new algorithms for mapping boolean constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) onto QA hardware mitigating these limitations. In particular we develop a new embedding algorithm for mapping a CSP onto a hardware Ising model with a fixed sparse set of interactions, and propose two new decomposition algorithms for solving problems too large to map directly into hardware. The mapping technique is locally-structured, as hardware compatible Ising models are generated for each problem constraint, and variables appearing in different constraints are chained together using ferromagnetic couplings. In contrast, global embedding techniques generate a hardware independent Ising model for all the constraints, and then use a minor-embedding algorithm to generate a hardware compatible Ising model. We give an example of a class of CSPs for which the scaling performance of D-Wave's QA hardware using the local mapping technique is significantly better than global embedding. We validate the approach by applying D-Wave's hardware to circuit-based fault-diagnosis. For circuits that embed directly, we find that the hardware is typically able to find all solutions from a min-fault diagnosis set of size N using 1000N samples, using an annealing rate that is 25 times faster than a leading SAT-based sampling method. Further, we apply decomposition algorithms to find min-cardinality faults for circuits that are up to 5 times larger than can be solved directly on current hardware.","2016-03-09","2022-04-26 14:50:07","2022-05-01 19:29:28","2022-04-26 14:50:07","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 1603.03111","Comment: 22 pages, 4 figures","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\S9FW34EE\Bian et al. - 2016 - Mapping constrained optimization problems to quant.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\YIEAWGH3\1603.html","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

When an electronic nose (E-nose) is used to detect the wound infection, sensor array’s optimization and parameters’ setting of classifier have a strong impact on the classification accuracy. Design/methodology/approach– An enhanced quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization based on genetic algorithm, genetic quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (G-QPSO), is proposed to realize a synchronous optimization of sensor array and classifier. The importance-factor (I-F) method is used to weight the sensors of E-nose by its degree of importance in classification.

The aim is to design an ANN with few connections and high classification performance by simultaneously optimizing the network structure and the connection weights. Unlike most previous studies, the proposed algorithm uses quantum bit representation to codify the network. As a result, the connectivity bits do not indicate the actual links but the probability of the existence of the connections, thus alleviating mapping problems and reducing the risk of throwing away a potential candidate. In addition, in the proposed model, each weight space is decomposed into subspaces in terms of quantum bits. Thus, the algorithm performs a region by region exploration, and evolves gradually to find promising subspaces for further exploitation. This is helpful to provide a set of appropriate weights when evolving the network structure and to alleviate the noisy fitness evaluation problem. The proposed model is tested on four benchmark problems, namely breast cancer and iris, heart, and diabetes problems.

For a fixed population size, the number of Q-bit individuals assigned to each objective solution decreases with increasing number of found non-dominated solutions. As a result, more or fewer Q-bit individuals assigned to each objective solution may lead a confused order of local and global search. To mitigate this issue, an adaptive population MQEA (APMQEA) is proposed in this work. In the APMQEA, the number of Q-bit individuals assigned to each objective solution is fixed, and the population size is adaptively changed according to the number of found non-dominated solutions. Experimental results for the multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problem show that the APMQEA finds solutions close to the Pareto-optimal front and maintains a good spread of the non-dominated set.","2013-09-10","2022-04-27 15:04:00","2022-05-01 17:02:12","2022-04-27 15:04:00","39-56","","","243","","Information Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VC94HFW8\Lu and Yu - 2013 - An adaptive population multi-objective quantum-ins.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Multi-objective optimization problem; Quantum bits; Multi-objective 0/1 knapsack problem; Multi-objective quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This ability has originated the quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs), which are classical algorithms (for classical computers) that exploit quantum mechanics principles to improve their performance. Several proposed QIEAs are able to outperform their traditional counterparts when applied to different kinds of problems. Aiming to exploit this new paradigm on genetic programming (GP), this paper introduces a novel QIEA model (quantum-inspired linear GP—QuaLiGP), which evolves machine code programs. QuaLiGP is inspired on multi-level quantum systems, and its operation is based on quantum individuals, which represent a superposition of all programs (solutions) of the search space. The tests use symbolic regression and binary classification as knowledge management problems to assess the QuaLiGP performance and compare it with Automatic Induction of Machine Code by Genetic Programming model, which is currently the most efficient GP model to evolve machine code. Results show that QuaLiGP outperforms the reference GP system for all these problems, by achieving better solutions from a smaller number of evaluations and by using fewer parameters and operators. This paper concludes that the quantum-inspired paradigm can be a competitive approach to evolve programs efficiently, encouraging improvements and extensions of QuaLiGP.","2013-09","2022-04-24 22:37:47","2022-04-28 13:49:14","","1043-1062","","9","56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: The Computer Journal","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\LRXQG7RN\Dias and Pacheco - 2013 - Quantum-Inspired Linear Genetic Programming as a K.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PVGUCU3S\8140364.html","","excluded; not an application","evolutionary computation; binary classification; genetic programming; quantum-inspired algorithms; symbolic regression","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aiming at the problem that genetic algorithm possesses the slow convergence speed and easily plunges in part convergence when solving the model of the transmission network expansion planning, this paper proposes a method of transmission network expansion planning based on improved quantum genetic algorithm. On the basis of the quantum genetic algorithm, the method proposes a strategy that the quantum chromosomes are directly compared with the current best solution to determine the rotating angle of the rotating gate. The strategy ensures every individual in population evolves with different convergence speed to complete both local and global search. Simultaneously, the whole interference crossover operation and negater mutation operation are put forward to prevent the algorithm plunging in part convergence. Three kinds of improvement strategies are targeted and can effectively improve the convergence function of quantum genetic algorithm in the planning for transmission network expansion.

We provided a new definition for the convergence rate of a stochastic algorithm as well as definitions for three types of convergence according to the correlations between the convergence rate and the objective function values.

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of the QPSO algorithm. In the theoretical analysis, we analyze the behavior of a single particle in QPSO in terms of probability measure. Since the particle's behavior is influenced by the contraction-expansion (CE) coefficient, which is the most important parameter of the algorithm, the goal of the theoretical analysis is to find out the upper bound of the CE coefficient, within which the value of the CE coefficient selected can guarantee the convergence or boundedness of the particle's position. In the experimental analysis, the theoretical results are first validated by stochastic simulations for the particle's behavior. Then, based on the derived upper bound of the CE coefficient, we perform empirical studies on a suite of well-known benchmark functions to show how to control and select the value of the CE coefficient, in order to obtain generally good algorithmic performance in real world applications. Finally, a further performance comparison between QPSO and other variants of PSO on the benchmarks is made to show the efficiency of the QPSO algorithm with the proposed parameter control and selection methods.","2012-09-01","2022-04-27 11:32:09","2022-04-28 12:44:44","2022-04-27 11:32:09","349-393","","3","20","","Evolutionary Computation","Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","Silverchair","","","","; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\GQDDRDGR\Quantum-Behaved-Particle-Swarm-Optimization.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\Y6CE2CVZ\Sun et al. - 2012 - Quantum-Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization Analy.pdf","http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21905841","excluded; not an application","Computer Simulation; Probability; Algorithms; Models, Theoretical; Quantum Theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithm pieces together the ideas from evolutionary algorithms (EA) and quantum computing to provide a robust optimisation technique that can be utilised to optimise highly constrained non-linear real-parameter functions. Quantum bits have immense representational power due to their being in superposition of all the basic states at the same time. New quantum operators designed in this work enable the search to effectively handle the twin objectives of exploitation and exploration. This enables the search to be pursued with small population sizes, thereby speeding up the search process and also ensuring that there is no problem of premature convergence that often plagues pure EA implementations. The power of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by solving the economic load dispatch (ELD) in power systems.

A new algorithm, called versatile quantum- inspired evolutionary algorithm (vQEA), is proposed. With vQEA, the attractors moving the population through the search space are replaced at every generation without considering their fitness. The new algorithm is much more reactive. It always adapts the search toward the last promising solution found thus leading to a smoother and more efficient exploration. In this paper, vQEA is tested and compared to a classical genetic algorithm CGA and to a QEA on several benchmark problems. Experiments have shown that vQEA performs better than both CGA and QEA in terms of speed and accuracy. It is a highly scalable algorithm as well. Finally, the properties of the vQEA are discussed and compared to estimation of distribution algorithms (EDA).","2007-09","2022-04-27 14:40:31","2022-04-28 11:29:24","","423-430","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 1941-0026","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DQ83W5PV\4424502.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VCF7XVUQ\Defoin Platel et al. - 2007 - A versatile quantum-inspired evolutionary algorith.pdf","","excluded; not recent","Genetic algorithms; Quantum computing; Evolutionary computation; Benchmark testing; Optimization methods; Electronic design automation and methodology; Analog computers; Face detection; Image registration; Signal processing algorithms","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2007 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, EA implementations often suffer from premature convergence due to the lack of proper balance between exploration and exploitation in the search process. This paper proposes a Hybrid Quantum inspired EA, which balances the exploration and exploitation in the search process by adaptively evolving the populations. It employs an adaptive quantum rotation based crossover operator designed by hybridizing a conventional crossover operator with the principles of Quantum Mechanics. The degree of rotation in this operator is determined adaptively. The proposed algorithm does not require either a mutation operator, to avoid premature convergence, or a local heuristic to improve convergence rate. Further, a parameter-tuning free hybrid technique is employed for handling constraints, which overcomes some limitations in the traditional techniques like penalty factor methods, by hybridizing Feasibility Rules method with Adaptive Penalty Factor method. It is implemented by using two populations, each evolving by applying one of the constraints handling techniques and swapping a part of the populations. A standard set of six diverse benchmark engineering design optimization problems have been used for testing the proposed algorithm. The algorithm exhibits superior performance than the existing state-of-the-art approaches.","2010","2022-04-27 14:42:44","2022-04-28 11:29:24","","225–235","","3","7","","Int. J. Hybrid Intell.

Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance.

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system. A quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) technique is presented in this paper to solve many-objective environmental economic dispatch (EED) problems. Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm. Quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization is implemented on a 6-unit system to solve many-objective EED problems, and at the same time, to show the effectiveness of QPSO in large systems, it is also implemented in a 26-unit power generation system for ED problem. The obtained results demonstrate and verify the effectiveness and robustness of QPSO to solve many-objective EED problems.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size. The performance of QEMEA is tested on six benchmark problems derived from the literature.

In the proposed method, QoS multicast routing is converted into an integer programming problem with QoS constraints and is solved by the QPSO algorithm combined with loop deletion operation. The QPSO-based routing method, along with the routing algorithms based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) and genetic algorithm (GA), is tested on randomly generated network topologies for the purpose of performance evaluation.

In order to obtain better optimization results, a parameter adaptive control method is used to update the crossover probability. And the problem of multi-objective optimization is solved by introducing a penalty factor. The experimental results show that: the evaluation index and convergence speed of the DE-CQPSO algorithm are better than QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) and other algorithms, whether it is single-objective optimization of fuel cost and emissions or multi-objective optimization considering both optimization objectives. A good compromise value is verified, which verifies the effectiveness and robustness of the DE-CQPSO algorithm in solving environmental economic dispatch problems.

The two local attractors, inside and outside, are introduced to construct the particle locations updating model, using the quantum tunneling and transition effects in double-potential well model. In this way, the particle moves to the solution sparseness region in later evolution stage, so as to avoid gathering in the single local attractor and escape from local optimum. Therefore the optimization accuracy of the algorithm is improved. The share-learning strategy is adopted to extend the search range of particles and increase the diversity of solutions. The problem of easily converging to boundary solutions in quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm could be avoided.

With two competing objectives and a set of operation constraints, the economic environmental hydrothermal scheduling problem is classified as a typical multi-objective nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Thus, in order to efficiently resolve this problem, the multi-objective quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOQPSO) is presented in this paper. In MOQPSO, the elite archive set is adopted to conserve Pareto optimal solutions and provide multiple evolutionary directions for individuals, while the neighborhood searching and chaotic mutation strategies are used to enhance the search capability and diversity of population. Furthermore, a novel constraint handling method is designed to adjust the constraint violation of hydro and thermal plants, respectively. In order to verify its effectiveness, the MOQPSO is applied to a classical hydrothermal system with four hydropower plants and three thermal plants.

This algorithm uses composed particles generated according to AHRN and emphasizes the importance of the composed particle with the highest fitness based on a social communication law. To improve the chance of finding the best global solution, the movement of the composed particle is affected by the subparticles as inner factors and by the swarm as outer factor.

The main reason is that new particles in QPSO are generated around the weighted attractors of previous best particles and the global best particle. This may result in attracting too fast. To tackle this problem, this paper proposes a new QPSO algorithm called NQPSO, in which one local and one global neighborhood search strategies are utilized to balance exploitation and exploration. Moreover, a concept of opposition-based learning (OBL) is employed for population initialization.

However, FCM is sensitive to the initialization of fuzziness factor (m) and the number of clusters (c) due to which it easily trapped in local optima. A selection of these parameters is a critical issue because an adverse selection can blur the clusters in the data. In the available fuzzy clustering literature, cluster validity index is used to determine the optimal number of clusters for the dataset, but these indexes may trap into the local optima due to the random selection of m. From the perspective of handling local optima problem, we proposed a hybrid fuzzy clustering approach referred as quantum-inspired evolutionary fuzzy c-means algorithm. In the proposed approach, we integrate the concept of quantum computing with FCM to evolve the parameter m in several generations. The evolution of fuzziness factor (m) with the quantum concept aims to provide the better characteristic of population diversity and large search space to find the global optimal value of m and its corresponding value of c. Experiments using three real-world datasets are reported and discussed.

The route planning for UAV on the sea is formulated as an optimization problem. A simple method of pretreatment to the terrain environment is proposed. A novel route planner for UAV is designed to generate a safe and flyable path in the presence of different threat environments based on the DEQPSO algorithm. To show the high performance of the proposed method, the DEQPSO algorithm is compared with the real-valued genetic algorithm, DE, standard particle swarm optimization (PSO), hybrid particle swarm with differential evolution operator, and QPSO in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and the convergence property.

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models. The results illustrate the validity of the idea that the proposed model can simultaneously provide forecasting with good accuracy and interpretability.","2016-03","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-05-12 16:15:55","","221 (20 pp.)","","3","9","","Energies","","Energies (Switzerland)","","","","","","","","","","","","","Place: Switzerland Publisher: MDPI AG","<p>Cited By :23</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/9/3/221/pdf</p>","; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\S9Y5ZW9B\Li-Ling Peng et al. - 2016 - Hybridizing DEMD and Quantum PSO with SVR in Elect.pdf","http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/en9030221","particle swarm optimisation; load forecasting; regression analysis; support vector machines; included; forward snowball; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For calibrating the QXQGA, the quantum crossover and mutation operators are evaluated using relative percentage deviation for selecting the best combination.

But as many other PSOs, it is easy to fall into local optimum in solving high-dimensional complex optimization problems. This paper proposes an improved QPSO algorithm for continuous non-linear large scale problems based on memetic algorithm and memory mechanism. The memetic algorithm is used to make all particles (each particle corresponding to a memetic) gain some experience through a local search before being involved in the evolutionary process, and the memory mechanism is used to introduce a so-called ‘bird kingdom’ with memory capacity, both of which can improve the global search ability of the algorithm. Another difference compared to the previous QPSOs is that we let each dimension of a particle update with the same random number, thus increasing the speed of convergence and enhancing the ability of local search. Numerical experiments are conducted to compare the proposed algorithm with different variants of PSO and other swarm intelligence algorithms. The experimental results show the superiority of the proposed approach on benchmark test functions.","2014-12-24","2022-04-27 12:55:22","2022-05-12 16:25:31","2022-04-27 12:55:22","162-189","","","289","","Information Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :67</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\LPEFY8IS\Tang et al. - 2014 - A quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization with.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Swarm intelligence; Quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization; Memetic algorithm; Continuous non-linear large scale problem; Memory mechanism","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, we offered a survey on applications of PSO to the following eight fields: electrical and electronic engineering, automation control systems, communication theory, operations research, mechanical engineering, fuel and energy, medicine, chemistry, and biology.

In this paper, we formulate QA representation of problems essential to mitigating the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, namely, the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP), the Physician Scheduling Problem (PSP), and the Nurse-Physician Scheduling Problem (NPSP). The proposed objective functions for each problem are scripted to the Ising model and then transformed into the quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) format. An optimal solution is sought for a set of constraints, including the number of nurses or physicians per shift and the maximum number of shifts for each nurse or physician. After reducing the proposed NSP, PSP, and NPSP QUBOs to a novel Ising type Hamiltonian, we obtain solutions from a classical (simulated) annealer, and then from the D-wave 2000Q forward and reverse annealer. Results from the reverse quantum annealer show a dramatic improvement in solution quality as compared to those from the classical annealer. We observe that the reverse annealing method gives us the most satisfactory output from among three heuristic processes used, for each scheduling problem.","2020-09-02","2022-05-04 10:56:42","2022-05-12 16:30:48","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","DOI: 10.13140/RG.2.2.22952.80648","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\STT42A7C\Sadhu et al. - 2020 - Quantum annealing for solving a nurse-physician sc.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Faisal-Khan-66/publication/344047176_Quantum_annealing_for_solving_a_nurse-physician_scheduling_problem_in_Covid-19_clinics/links/5f4fd13f458515e96d256d14/Quantum-annealing-for-solving-a-nurse-physician-scheduling-problem-in-Covid-19-clinics.pdf","excluded; not peer-reviewed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It integrated with suggested novel PSO (nPSO) and DE (nDE). Where in nPSO, a new, inertia weight and acceleration coefficient as well as position update equation are familiarized, to escape stagnation. And in nDE, a new, mutation strategy and crossover rate is introduced, to avoid premature convergence. In order to balance between global and local search capability, after calculation of ihPSODE population, best half member has been identified and rest members discarded. Further, in current population nPSO is employed to maintain exploration and exploitation, then nDE is used to enhance convergence accuracy. The proposed ihPSODE and its suggested component nPSO and nDE have been tested over IEEE CEC2006 (it comprising linear, nonlinear, polynomial, quadratic, and cubic functions), IEEE CEC2014, and IEEE CEC2017 (these test suites consist of unimodal, multimodal, hybrid, and composition functions) well‐known benchmark functions. Then, the efficacy of the proposed algorithms has been demonstrated on nonconvex economic load dispatch problems which consist of 3‐, 6‐, 15‐, 40‐, and 140‐unit test systems. The comparative results with some of the state‐of‐the‐art algorithms confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms in both aspects of better quality solutions and higher efficiency. A widespread survey of numerous meta‐heuristic algorithms has been investigated. A novel PSO (nPSO) and DE (nDE) with their innovative hybrid (ihPSODE) are proposed.

Derived from biological system swarm intelligence algorithm attract many researcher due to its simplicity and adaptable nature with real-life problem. But swarm algorithms suffer from its search process. Higher rate of exploitation may trap to pre-mature solution and higher rate of exploration may slow down the process or may not true solution. In this paper, we present detailed analysis and sorting of search strategies based on its property and structure to get optimum of exploration and exploitation for swarm algorithms. In our study, we cluster majority of strategies in to information sharing and change in structure. In first part, sharing of information is categorized by population initialization, population update and population control. In second part, change in structure is categorized by modification in governing equation, hybridization and new topology.

In this paper, a multi-cut Benders decomposition (BD) approach that exploits multiple feasible solutions of the master problem (MP) to generate multiple valid cuts is adapted, so as to be used as an HQC solver for general mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problems. The use of different cut selection criteria and strategies to manage the size of the MP by eliciting a subset of cuts to be added in each iteration of the BD scheme using quantum computing is discussed. The HQC optimization algorithm is applied to the Unit Commitment (UC) problem. UC is a prototypical use case of optimization applied to electrical power systems, a critical sector that may benefit from advances in quantum computing.

However, existing multi-objective search algorithms have certain randomness when selecting parent solutions for producing offspring solutions. In a worse case, suboptimal parent solutions may result in offspring solutions with bad quality, and thus affect the overall quality of the solutions in the next generation. To address such a challenge, we propose CBGA-ES+, a novel cluster-based genetic algorithm with non-dominated elitist selection to reduce the randomness when selecting the parent solutions to support multi-objective test optimization. We empirically compared CBGA-ES+ with random search and greedy (as baselines), four commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (i.e., Multi-objective Cellular genetic algorithm (MOCell), NSGA-II, Pareto Archived Evolution Strategy (PAES), and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (SPEA2)), and the predecessor of CBGA-ES+ (named CBGA-ES) using five multi-objective test optimization problems with eight subjects (two industrial, one real world, and five open source). The results showed that CBGA-ES+ managed to significantly outperform the selected search algorithms for a majority of the experiments. Moreover, for the solutions in the same search space, CBGA-ES+ managed to perform better than CBGA-ES, MOCell, NSGA-II, PAES, and SPEA2 for 2.2, 13.6, 14.5, 17.4, and 9.9 percent, respectively. Regarding the running time of the algorithm, CBGA-ES+ was faster than CBGA-ES for all the experiments.","2021","2022-05-04 12:38:40","2022-05-13 22:24:28","","86-107","","1","47","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units.

Moreover, there are few scenarios where the demand of the product is assessed in two-layer information. The inner layer demand is obvious, and it may extend up to the outer layer depending on the situation. Also, the same thing may happen for the defective rate of the product. In those cases, it is more reasonable to express the demand and the defective rate as rough intervals instead of fuzzy or interval numbers. Based on the expected value of rough intervals, the necessary and sufficient conditions are determined analytically to obtain the optimal inventory policies. The main advantage of this method is that the optimal profit and the optimal lot size are determined as crisp numbers rather than rough intervals. Obtaining a precise value for these two quantities is desirable for any production manager. Numerical examples for both models are provided to illustrate the solution methodology. Sensitivity analysis of the optimal solutions concerning the key parameters is conducted for identifying several managerial implications.","2021-03-24","2022-05-04 11:21:40","2022-05-13 22:08:58","2022-05-04 11:21:40","","","","","","Oper Res Int J","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7N6NLQ34\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production-repairing inventory model considering.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Imperfect production system; Production inventory model; Rough interval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a new multi-objective squirrel search algorithm to solve the combined economic and environmental power dispatch problem. The proposed multi-objective squirrel search algorithm integrates squirrel search algorithm along with Pareto-dominance principle to generate non-dominated solutions. It uses an external elitist depository mechanism with crowding distance sorting to maintain the distribution diversity of Pareto-optimal solutions as the evolution proceeds. In addition, a fuzzy decision-making strategy is used to select the best compromised solution from the obtained Pareto frontiers. The combined economic and environmental power dispatch problem is also solved by squirrel search algorithm based weighted sum approach, which transfers both the fuel cost and emission objectives into a single-objective function. The performances of multi-objective squirrel search algorithm are tested on three test systems with diverse complexities. The simulation results and comparisons with the other state-of-the-art heuristic algorithms confirm that the proposed multi-objective squirrel search algorithm for combined economic and environmental power dispatching can obtain a better trade-off between fuel cost and emission objectives.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:13","2022-05-13 22:08:38","","106950","","","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2HX9ITQF\Sakthivel et al. - 2021 - Combined economic and emission power dispatch prob.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Multi-objective optimization; Economic emission dispatch; Pareto front solution; Squirrel search algorithm; Valve point loading","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real ""Dongda-Keyuan"" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume. Furthermore, we found that dynamic changes in traffic light signal duration greatly reduce traffic congestion.","2021-11","2022-05-03 15:49:33","2022-05-13 22:06:38","","74-81","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2693-8421","<p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\L2YQSACW\9704985.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\S84X95F3\9704985.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\3ZULA6CL\Singh et al. - 2021 - Quantum Annealing Approach for the Optimal Real-ti.pdf","","included","quantum computing; Annealing; Real-time systems; Urban areas; Motorcycles; Quantum annealing; quantum annealing; Roads; Correlation; QUBO; real-time optimization; traffic optimization; traffic signal control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 IEEE/ACIS 22nd International Conference on Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence, Networking and Parallel/Distributed Computing (SNPD)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Using a technique established in previous experiments, we design our experiment such that (at least on timescales relevant to our study) the false minimum is reached preferentially in forward annealing due to high levels of quantum fluctuations. This allows us to demonstrate the key principle of reverse annealing, that the solution space can be searched locally, preferentially finding nearby solutions, even in the presence of a false minimum. The techniques used here are distinct from previously used experimental techniques and allow us to probe the fundamental search range of the device in an alternative way. We perform these experiments on two flux qubit quantum annealers, one with higher noise levels than the other. We find evidence that the lower noise device is more likely to find the more distant energy minimum (the false minimum in this case), suggesting that reducing noise fundamentally increases the range over which flux qubit quantum annealers are able to search. Our work explains why reducing the noise leads to improved performance on these quantum annealers. This supports the idea that these devices may be able to search over broad regions of the solution space quickly, one of the core reasons why quantum annealers are viewed as a potential avenue for a quantum computational advantage.","2021-07-15","2022-05-04 10:36:44","2022-05-13 22:05:20","2022-05-04 10:36:44","012604","","1","104","","Phys.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality. Hence, we were able to solve small problem instances extracted from real data with the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer.","2019","2022-04-25 14:01:15","2022-05-13 22:04:33","","99-110","","","","","","","Lecture Notes in Computer Science","","","","Springer International Publishing","Cham","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>https://elib.dlr.de/123778/1/20180709_SIAM_Annual_Meeting.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2MYGAWJY\Stollenwerk et al. - 2019 - Flight Gate Assignment with a Quantum Annealer.pdf","","included; forward snowball","Quantum annealing; QUBO; Airport planning; Quadratic assignment problem","Feld, Sebastian; Linnhoff-Popien, Claudia","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.","2021","2022-04-11 15:14:51","2022-05-13 22:04:33","","691-696","","","","","","","RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems","","","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Compilation and indexing terms, Copyright 2022 Elsevier Inc.</p>; <p>Export Date: 7 April 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 April 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\B9BIPMP8\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ","http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853","Operations research; Optimization; Quantum computers; Annealing; Recommender systems; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; forward snowball; reverse snowball","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in arid areas, the comprehensive study of soil quality has been paid little attention. This paper aims to classify and evaluate comprehensive soil quality which combined heavy metal contamination with soil nutrients in the arid area, and to explore the natural environmental controlling factors of soil quality under regional differences. Taking Hexi area, a typical arid area in northwest China, as the study area, the comprehensive evaluation model of soil quality based on back propagation artificial neural network (BP - ANN) was proposed. The results showed that the accuracies of the validated models were both more than 97 %. The soil quality in Hexi area was divided into six classes: IA, IB, IC, IIA, IIB, IIC (The number (I and II) represents the degree of heavy metal pollution, the larger the number, the higher the pollution degree; the letter (A, B, and C) represents the nutrient level, the latter the letter, the more barren the nutrient). Most of the samples were classified as IB and IC, indicating that the soil quality was good with mild heavy metal contamination and poorer nutrients. Group analysis was used to explore the impact of natural environmental factors on soil quality under different environmental characteristics through linear regression modeling. The results showed that elevation, annual mean cumulative precipitation, slope and topographic wetness index were the environmental controlling factors of the soil quality for all samples. Besides, the other important factors affecting soil quality in group 1 were: annual mean temperature and soil type. For group 2 it was LUCC (Land Use Cover Change). This study is of great significance to classify and define the soil quality, to maintain and improve agricultural production and soil ecological health in arid areas.","2021-04-01","2022-05-04 11:33:20","2022-05-13 22:03:14","2022-05-04 11:33:20","104907","","","208","","Soil and Tillage Research","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\G5CGX6NK\Shao et al. - 2021 - Application of BP - ANN model in evaluation of soi.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\QPM9238R\S0167198720306899.html","","excluded; not an application","Arid area; BP - ANN; Heavy metal; Soil nutrient; Soil quality evaluation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the MES, the hybrid energy storage system (HESS) composed of the battery and thermal storage tank plays an important role in enhancing reliability, economics, and operational flexibility. Hence, determining the optimal size of HESS in the MES is a critical problem but has not received enough attention. In light of this problem, this paper focuses on the optimal HESS planning problem in the community MES (CMES) under diverse uncertainties. Firstly, a two-stage stochastic planning model is proposed for the CMES to coordinate the optimal long-term HESS allocation and the short-term system operation. The thermal inertia in the heating network, space heating demand, and domestic hot water demand is utilized to reduce both the planning and operational cost. Secondly, a deterministic equivalence is proposed for the two-stage planning model to convert it into a mixed-integer linear programming model, which is then solved by off-the-shelf solvers. Finally, simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The results reveal that the HESS can enhance the operational flexibility of the CMES but only needs a very few investment costs and prove that the thermal inertia in the CMES can reduce the investment cost of HESS, the fuel, and the operational maintenance cost.","2021","2022-05-03 17:18:15","2022-05-13 22:03:02","","61035-61047","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","<p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9312710/09408593.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\85F68C5Y\9408593.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\D6N8V7WR\9408593.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UQGA66X9\Shen et al. - 2021 - Optimal Hybrid Energy Storage System Planning of C.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Planning; Uncertainty; Batteries; Space heating; Load modeling; Renewable energy sources; uncertainty; renewable energy; Battery; hybrid energy storage system; Stochastic processes; community multi-energy system; mixed-integer linear programming; operational flexibility; thermal storage tank; two-stage stochastic programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The novel energy conversion process proposed consisting of an alkaline fuel cell (AFC), wind turbine (WT) and alkaline electrolyzer (AEL) with pumped hydro-compressed air electrical energy system (PC-EES) to store energy. WT and AFC convert the wind kinetic energy and the fuel chemical energy into electricity, respectively. The electricity generated by the WT provides the power needed by the AEL to provide fuel and oxidant of the AFC. The unused electricity of the WT and output power of the AFC is stored by the PC-EES system. By considering the rate hydrogen production of 0.01 kg/h for AEL, it was found that the electrolyzer consumes 628.4 W of electricity (from WT) and the AFC generates 70.4 W of electrical power. Furthermore, the mean output and efficiency of the WT are 1.91 kW and 19.1%, respectively. Also, the storage efficiency of the system was 70.8%.

In recent years, with the technical development of quantum annealers, research on solving practical combinatorial optimization problems using them has accelerated. However, researchers struggle to find practical combinatorial optimization problems, for which quantum annealers outperform mathematical optimization solvers. Moreover, there are only a few studies that compare the performance of quantum annealers with the state-of-the-art solvers, such as Gurobi and CPLEX. This study determines that quantum annealing demonstrates better performance than the solvers in that the solvers take longer to reach the objective function value of the solution obtained by the quantum annealers for the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament. We also explain the desirable performance of quantum annealing for the sparse interaction between variables and a problem without constraints. In this process, we demonstrate that this problem can be expressed as a 4-regular graph. Through computational experiments, we solve this problem using our quantum annealing approach and two-integer programming approaches, which were performed using the latest quantum annealer D-Wave Advantage, and Gurobi, respectively. Further, we compare the quality of the solutions and the computational time. Quantum annealing was able to determine the exact solution in 0.05 seconds for problems with 20 teams, which is a practical size. In the case of 36 teams, it took 84.8 s for the integer programming method to reach the objective function value, which was obtained by the quantum annealer in 0.05 s. These results not only present the break minimization problem in a mirrored double round-robin tournament as an example of applying quantum annealing to practical optimization problems, but also contribute to find problems that can be effectively solved by quantum annealing.","2022-08-04","2022-05-04 10:46:52","2022-05-13 21:53:32","2022-05-04 10:46:52","e0266846","","4","17","","PLOS ONE","","","","","","","","en","","","","","PLoS Journals","","Publisher: Public Library of Science","<p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266846&amp;type=printable</p>; <p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266846&amp;type=printable</p>; <p>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0266846&amp;type=printable</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ETX37MFR\Kuramata et al. - 2022 - Solving large break minimization problems in a mir.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Simulated annealing; Qubits; Time measurement; Games; Finance; Sports; Combinatorics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to these features, solving the OPF problem is becoming a well-known area to be solved by researchers for the past decades especially involving with the proper optimizing of the control variables. This issue is vital to be solved in achieving the objectives while maintaining of the stability of the system. In this paper, recent metaheuristic algorithm namely Barnacles Mating Optimizer (BMO) will be used to solve three objective functions of OPF problem viz. (1) cost minimization of the power generation that consists of thermal and stochastic wind–solar–small hydro power generations, (2) power loss minimization, and (3) combined cost and emission minimization of mentioned power generations. To assess the performance of BMO into OPF problem, modified IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems that incorporate the stochastic wind–solar–small hydro power generators will be employed. Statistical studies are performed to show the feasible and effectiveness of BMO compared with other selected metaheuristic algorithms. Based on the obtained results, the BMO has shown the best results for all cases of simulation study. For example, the cost of power generations obtained by BMO for IEEE 30-bus and IEEE 57-bus systems are 789.1248 $/h and 5300.457 $/hr, respectively which 1.45% and 2.2% cost saving per hour compared to the worst results obtained from compared algorithms.

The Endurance Time, which is a dynamic analysis method, requires low computation efforts, unlike other commonly related methods. The population-based, stochastic search algorithm based on the ideal gas molecular movement (IGMM) has established its capability in solving complex numerical and engineering problems. Therefore, the LCCA-based probabilistic optimization of a 3D RC structure is carried out based on the FEMA-P-58 using the ET method and the IGMM algorithm to find the global optimum design. The results show that the repair costs of flexural connections and structural elements have the largest share in the life cycle costs because these elements, especially flexural connections, play an essential role in the damage of structures under seismic loads. Based on the results, the use of the optimization process leads to the proper distribution of materials in the structures, and also it can reduce the lifetime repair costs by 12% and the total construction costs by 8.5% without increasing the initial costs of construction.","2021-11-01","2022-05-05 18:22:50","2022-05-13 21:47:20","2022-05-05 18:22:50","103032","","","43","","Journal of Building Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AYX36M4G\Varaee et al. - 2021 - The life-cycle cost analysis based on probabilisti.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Monte Carlo method; 3D reinforcement concrete structures; Endurance time method; Ideal gas molecular movement algorithm; Probabilistic optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The limitation comes from the workload demand on the air traffic controllers. Currently, the air traffic flow management is based on the flight path requests by the airline operators, whereas the minimum separation assurance between flights is handled strategically by air traffic control personnel. In this paper, we propose a scalable framework that allows path planning for a large number of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) taking into account the deadline and weather constraints. Our proposed solution has a polynomial-time computational complexity that is also verified by measuring the runtime for typical workloads. We further demonstrate that the proposed framework is able to route 80% of the workloads while not exceeding the sector capacity constraints, even under dynamic weather conditions. Due to low computational complexity, our framework is suitable for a fleet of UAVs where decentralizing the routing process limits the workload demand on the air traffic personnel.","2021","2022-05-04 11:07:13","2022-05-13 21:47:01","","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UTY84I5J\9615029.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2D62QD92\Vaidhun et al. - 2021 - Dynamic Path Planning for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Data models; Safety; Routing; simulation; Meteorology; routing; Atmospheric modeling; Path planning; Air traffic; conflict avoidance; unmanned aircraft; Vehicle dynamics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The definition of an intelligent city may vary based on the context and the purpose served. However, the next generation of intelligent cities will have unique characteristics that will set them apart from the existing intelligent cities. They will be more people-centered, and they will be formed through the fusion of technology, government, organizations, and people. This chapter explores four intelligent cities in Europe that are setting examples for innovation, ingenuity, technology, public policy making, and sustainable development: London, Amsterdam, Vienna, and Stockholm. With growing emphasis on people involvement in decision making, the intelligent city ecosystem is continuously evolving. However, technology continues to play a prominent role in shaping the intelligent city paradigm. In this contribution, the authors also examine different emerging technologies such as quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, AI, ML, etc. that could potentially impact the next generation of such cities.","2021","2022-05-04 10:49:25","2022-05-13 21:46:55","","87-111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-5062-5.ch004","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It involves the following essential modules. (i) Dynamic economic dispatch is a true dynamic optimization formulation. With real time measurements and both supply and demand modelling, the optimization will produce the optimal plant operation modes and settings which give the highest efficiency of the overall system and are fed back to the plants for execution. (ii) Dynamic sensing is real time sensing and data acquisition system to access the real operating status of the generation plant with measurement of relevant variables. The big data technology is adopted for construction of the overall hardware and software to store huge volume of plant and market data and perform fast off line modelling and design as well as on line real time control. (iii) Dynamic modelling is model building to forecast energy demands and generation over time. Under the DED, these modules are well integrated to work together and achieve an optimal demand management for maximum energy efficiency.

The old ways of aggregating all objectives into one may very well be behind us. We perform a well-deserved literature survey of SBSE papers that used multiobjective search to find Pareto-optimal solutions, and we pay special attention to the chosen algorithms, tools, and quality indicators, if any. We conclude that the SBSE field has seen a trend of adopting the Multiobjective Evolutionary Optimization Algorithms (MEOAs) that are widely used in other fields (such as NSGA-II and SPEA2) without much scrutiny into the reason why one algorithm should be preferred over the others. We also find that the majority of published work only tackled two-objective problems (or formulations of problems), leaving much to be desired in terms of exploiting the power of MEOAs to discover solutions to intractable problems characterized by many trade-offs and complex constraints.","2013-05","2022-05-04 12:37:20","2022-05-13 21:44:21","","21-27","","","","","","Pareto-optimal search-based software engineering (POSBSE)","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\M8UPKGH7\6615200.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\79PQUPWM\Sayyad and Ammar - 2013 - Pareto-optimal search-based software engineering (.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Software algorithms; Search problems; Algorithm design and analysis; Software engineering; Software; Pareto optimization; Multiobjective Optimization; Pareto-Optimal Solutions; Search-Based Software Engineering","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2013 2nd International Workshop on Realizing Artificial Intelligence Synergies in Software Engineering (RAISE)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, an increasing number of severe flight collision events caused by explosive growth of UAV have drawn widespread concern. It is an important issue to investigate safety management approaches of UAVs to ensure safe and efficient operation. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of safety management approaches in large, middle and small scales. In large-scale safety management, path-planning problem is a crucial issue to ensure safety and ordered operation of UAVs globally. In middle-scale safety management, it is an important issue to study the conflict detection and resolution methods. And in small-scale safety management, real-time collision avoidance is the last line of ensuring safety. Moreover, a UAV can be regarded as a terminal device connected through communication and information network. Therefore, the enabling technologies, such as sensing, command and control communication, and collaborative decision-making control technology, have been studied in the last.","2018","2022-05-04 14:49:14","2022-05-13 21:44:06","","1-14","","4","3","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The natural evolution of SBSE is bringing new challenges, such as the need of a large number of objectives to formally represent the many decision criteria involved in the resolution of SE tasks. This suggests that SBSE is moving towards many-objective optimisation, an emerging area that provides advanced techniques to cope with high-dimensional optimisation problems. To analyse this phenomenon, this paper surveys relevant SBSE literature focused on the resolution of many-objective problems. From the gathered knowledge, current limitations regarding problem formulation, algorithm selection, experimental design and industrial applicability are discussed. Through the analysis of observed trends, this survey provides a historical perspective and future lines of research concerning the adoption of many-objective optimisation within SBSE.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:40","2022-05-13 21:43:59","","382-395","","","149","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

UAVs are particularly useful for applications where the absence of communications may cause high risks placing human lives in danger. At the same time, in order to handle relatively large regions, multi-UAV systems with effective collaboration, which support mission completions in efficient and economical ways, are required. Additionally, especially for mission critical applications, the context-specific network should be stable and reliable. For the use of UAVs in most effective way, there are still a variety of aspects, which require contributions from researchers. Since UAV networks come with unique characteristics such as rapidly changing topologies, varying levels of dynamism from slow dynamic to dynamic, and fragile links, existing studies on Ad Hoc Networks (MANETs), and Vehicular Ad Hoc Networks (VANETs) are not able to fulfill their requirements. Indeed, the protocols to be developed should be able to adapt to high mobility, dynamic topology, varying power constraints, and various levels of link qualities. Evaluation of these protocols from various perspectives is therefore very critical. The protocols considered in various levels should be able to support features such as energy efficiency, high connectivity, delay sensitiveness, high reliability, and security. In this study, the existing MAC and routing protocols are considered critically together with their characteristics, which may be critical for performance in terms of quality of service and energy efficiency.","2020","2022-05-04 14:49:18","2022-05-13 21:43:51","","57-77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-12-819972-5.00004-5","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A multi-objective Pareto type optimization approach is used to evaluate the inconsistent points of the optimization design namely those of minimizing the directional deviation while achieving maximum braking forces on wheels. Moreover, the optimal target slip values defined by the braking purposes like as shorter stopping distance and stability increment by keeping the vehicle in the straight line. This gets by the control of the longitudinal and lateral slip dynamics of each wheel concerning to the road conditions. A controller is optimally brought up by manipulating optimal control law with weights of two control inputs with mathematical and probabilistic characterization. The first-passage probability of critical response levels is used to directly control the vehicle directional stability. An impressive simulation technique based on Monte Carlo method named asymptotic sampling is applied to define the required first-passage probabilities and the Latin Hypercube sampling is used to design of experiments and to cover the design space. Afterwards, a Pareto-type optimization approach is applied to a trade-off between the inconsistent points of the optimization design. The simulation is conducted by the validated vehicle model and the results are indicated that the probability-based control design is represented as a preferable braking performance in comparison with the other systems for braking in sever conditions.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:43","2022-05-13 21:43:49","","128385-128406","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/09139252.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

As a natural heuristic algorithm, the butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) has the advantages of simple adjustment parameters and fast convergence speed. It is widely used to solve nonlinear programming problems. However, BOA is easy to fall into local optimization and poor convergence accuracy. Therefore, an improved butterfly optimization algorithm (IBOA) based on skew tent chaotic map, Cauchy mutation, and simplex method is proposed, and compared with particle swarm optimization (PSO), whale optimization algorithm (WOA), sparrow search algorithm (SSA), and BOA, the results show that the IBOA has high convergence speed and optimization accuracy. Finally, the IBOA is used to solve the optimization model. The simulation results show that the IBOA can effectively reduce the power consumption cost of the system, promote the effective utilization of renewable energy, and improve the operation stability of the microgrid cluster system.","2022-01-31","2022-05-03 14:59:40","2022-05-12 22:55:56","2022-05-03 14:59:40","e7041778","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.hindawi.com","","Publisher: Hindawi","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8WHZ3S8X\Zhang et al. - 2022 - Research on Economic Optimal Dispatching of Microg.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\V3SENKJB\7041778.html","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is easier to be in not a global state but a local optimal state, as the particle swarm optimization algorithm cannot update the population samples during the iterative process. And the search performance of the particle swarm optimization algorithm is poor in complex optimization problems. To solve these problems, a quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm based on a truncated mean stabilization strategy is designed. In the proposed algorithm, the processed particles are firstly intercepted with equal proportions, and then the worst particles are replaced by new particles during the iterative process, finally the global optimal value is located with the quantum wave function. The proposed strategy can improve population diversification and increase convergence efficiency. The performance of the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization algorithm with truncated mean stabilization strategy is researched on a set of unimodal and multimodal benchmark function optimization problems, and is compared with several popular population-based algorithms. Experimental results show that the search accuracy and the convergence of the quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with truncated mean stabilization strategy are better than other typical particle swarm optimization variants.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:21","2022-05-12 22:53:43","","42","","2","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CBLYVE5V\Zhou et al. - 2022 - Quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm with.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Particle swarm optimization; Benchmark function; Optimization problem; Quantum-behaved algorithm; Truncated mean stabilization strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Three objectives are considered: minimizing expected makespan, expected cost and robustness. Chance constrained programming is applied for formulating this stochastic problem. A hybrid approach that integrates sample average approximation (SAA) and an improved multi-objective chaotic quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (MOCQPSO) algorithm is proposed. To improve the diversity of solutions and enhance the global search ability, a two-stage learning strategy that balances the exploration and the exploitation is proposed for MOCQPSO. In addition, chaotic operators including chaotic initialisation, crossover and mutation are also introduced. Six benchmark functions and an instance generator based on the RCPSP dataset of PSPLIB are designed to validate the performance of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms the original algorithms in solution diversity and quality.","2022","2022-05-11 15:23:38","2022-05-12 22:52:11","","117029","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\M58NZ8WW\Zhou et al. - 2022 - Multi-objective stochastic project scheduling with.pdf","","excluded; not peer-reviewed","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To speed up the convergence speed and advance the simulation results, opposition based learning (OBL) is integrated with the fundamental GOA in OGOA algorithm. To show the nonlinearity of wind power availability the Weibull distribution is used. A standard system, containing of two wind farms and six thermal units is used for testing the dispatch model for three different loads. The statistical outcomes of the applied OGOA technique are compared with basic GOA and quantum-inspired particle swarm optimization (QPSO) optimization.

This overheads seriously degrade the performance of hybrid algorithms since they involve frequent communication. In this poster, we first state issues in the design of Ising computing platforms, including communication overheads. Then, we answer the issues by introducing the computing platform for the coherent Ising machine (CIM), an Ising computer based on photonics technologies.

Thus, the current study predicted CO2 emissions based on data from the agricultural sectors of 25 provinces in Iran. The gross domestic product (GDP), the square of the GDP (GDP2), energy use, and income inequality (Gini index) were used as the inputs. The study used support vector machine (SVM) models to predict CO2 emissions. Multiobjective algorithms (MOAs), such as the seagull optimization algorithm (MOSOA), salp swarm algorithm (MOSSA), bat algorithm (MOBA), and particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm, were used to perform three important tasks for improving the SVM models. Additionally, an inclusive multiple model (IMM) used the outputs of the MOSOA, MOSSA, MOBA, and MOPSO algorithms as the inputs for predicting CO2 emissions. It was observed that the best kernel function based on the SVM-MOSOA was the radial function. Additionally, the best input combination used all the gross domestic product (GDP), squared GDP (GDP2), energy use, and income inequality (Gini index) inputs. The results indicated that the quality of the obtained Pareto front based on the MOSOA was better than those of the other algorithms. Regarding the obtained results, the IMM model decreased the mean absolute errors of the SVM-MOSOA, SVM-MOSSA, SVM-MOBA, and SVM-PSO models by 24, 31, 69, and 76%, respectively, during the training stage.

In this two-dimensional setting it is not appropriate to use traditional ranking metrics designed for a single ranking list. It is well known that users do not explore a two-dimensional interface one row at a time, but rather focus their attention in a triangular area at the top-left corner. Furthermore, it is frequent for user interfaces to hide some items or lists due to space constraints, which can be shown by performing certain actions (i.e., click, swipe). In this paper we extend the widely used NDCG to a two-dimensional recommendation setting with a formulation that allows to account both the two-dimensional user exploration behaviour and interface-specific design. We also compare the proposed extension against single-list NDCG highlighting that they can lead to a different choice of the optimal algorithm in offline evaluation.","","2022-05-03 15:03:28","2022-05-12 22:21:16","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7R6DBXS6\Felicioni - Measuring the Ranking Quality of Recommendations i.pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In the proposed algorithm, the first modification introduced consists of dynamically adjusting the production operator to achieve the global search during the first trial, and then, during the next trials, the production operator adjusted dynamically to guide the other particles to perform local search. The second modification introduced within the standard algorithm is the adaptation of an interactive split technique to enhance the convergence behavior of the algorithm. In this paper the proposed Adaptive Split AEO (ASAEO) is applied to solve the non-smooth economic dispatch considering practical operation constraints, such as the valve point effect, the prohibited zones, the ramp rate limits and the total power losses. Also, and to relieve conflict on many results found in the recent literature using various metaheuristic methods and to demonstrate the particularity of the proposed power system planning strategy, a critical review is presented. In the literature, it is found that many comparative studies have been elaborated based on different databases, and these elaborated comparative studies may be misleading and difficult to judge the real contribution of many proposed optimization methods. Based on a statistical review, it is clearly confirmed that for the six test systems, two technical databases are available, and for the 13 generating units and 40 generating units, two databases are available in the literature. The particularity of the proposed variant named ASAEO has been validated on three standard test systems. The obtained results using the proposed technique compared to many recent methods are competitive for various test systems in terms of solution accuracy and convergence behavior.","","2022-05-03 16:13:22","2022-05-12 22:20:51","","1-23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VJ3AG82I\Mahdad - 2022 - Adaptive Split Artificial Ecosystem-Based Optimiza.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Economic dispatch; Adaptive artificial ecosystem; Power loss; Prohibited zones; Ramp rate limits; Split technique; Valve point effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tail Assignment is the problem of allocating individual aircraft to a set of ﬂights, while ensuring multiple constraints and aiming to minimise an objective function, such as operational costs. Given the enormous amount of possibilities and constraints involved, this problem has been a study case for the last decade. Many solutions have emerged using classical computing, but with limitations regarding performance. Quantum Annealing (QA) is a heuristic technique for ﬁnding global minimum energy levels over an energy landscape using quantum mechanics. Due to its characteristics, it has been proved to have a clear advantage in solving some complex optimisation problems, being a promising technique to apply in multiple ﬁelds. In this study, Tail Assignment Problem was set as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimisation (QUBO) model, using two different techniques, and was solved using a classical and two hybrid solvers. Tests were run based on extractions from real-world data, analysing the performance of the implementation in terms of time, scalability and quality (i.e., the lowest operational costs) of the obtained solutions. We concluded that using a library for modelling the problem as well as considering individual ﬂights rather than pre-aggregating them in strings can be a bottleneck when it comes to its scalability. Furthermore, we found out that there was a higher probability of obtaining better solutions for this problem using one of the hybrid solvers when compared with the classical heuristic algorithms such as Simulated Annealing (SA). These ﬁndings can serve as foundations for further studies.","","2022-05-04 12:01:28","2022-05-12 22:14:53","","100","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Zotero","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8K8PEZYE\Martins - Applying Quantum Annealing to the Tail Assignment .pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Considering the requirements for energy storage in energy hubs, different energy storage models have been studied in the literature. However, proposing a comprehensive multi-storage model is a necessity in this context. In the present research, a multiobjective optimization model has been developed to determine the optimal operational scenario in an energy hub. The novel dynamic energy storage hub (DESH) concept with interconnected short- and long-term electricity storage facilities is well defined. Also, the synergy advantageous due to the connection of thermal and electrical storage units through the DESH scheme is proposed. Moreover, technoeconomic merits of storing surplus power in hybrid energy systems using ammonia as the energy carrier in presence of renewable energy sources (RES) are investigated. In this regard, the effects of different meteorological conditions and also various time horizons have been examined for a commercial consumer. The current results show the applicability of the proposed model for increasing the energy hub performance considering defined assessment tools. Compared with the base case, results for a 3-day operating plan of the DESH in April reveal that exergy destruction and operational costs for the best operating scenario are decreased by 24.36% and 21.63%, respectively. Also, the energy hub produces 3.5 tons of ammonia utilizing the available surplus power of the conventional power plant and RES. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that adding environmental penalty costs in the optimization model increases the operational costs by 21% and decreases the available surplus power of in-service gas turbogenerators for storage up to 54% in the best operating scenario.","","2022-05-03 15:53:39","2022-05-12 22:14:41","2022-05-03 15:53:39","","","n/a","n/a","","","Multiobjective operational optimization of energy hubs","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/er.7977","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7PCGRF8U\Nozari et al. - Multiobjective operational optimization of energy .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\LJ9UWKYJ\er.html","","excluded; not an application","multiobjective optimization; ammonia synthesis; dynamic energy storage hub; energy hub; multi-storage model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To solve this problem, a hybrid multi-objective algorithm with effective constraint handling method based on Harris hawks optimization and differential evolution is proposed: (1) the concept of Pareto domination is integrated into Harris hawks optimization to deal with economic emission dispatch problem with two conflicting objectives; (2) the optimization mechanism of Harris hawks optimization is modified to enhance its optimization capabilities; (3) a non-dominated sorting method based on new crowding distance, which can obtain Pareto optimal front with excellent uniformity, is used to maintain the external archive and to select the guiders; (4) aiming at the constraints of economic emission dispatch problem, a feasible solution dominated constraint processing method is adopted to obtain feasible solutions; (5) moreover, to enhance the convergence performance of the algorithm, a differential evolution is used to evolve the individuals in the archive. Experimental results on the IEEE 30-bus 6-unit test system demonstrate that the quality of the solutions obtained by the suggested approach is better than that of several existing algorithms.","","2022-05-03 16:13:14","2022-05-12 22:12:04","","9399-9411","","10","46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\Z8DLVGAM\Xia et al. - 2021 - Hybrid MHHO-DE Algorithm for Economic Emission Dis.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Multi-objective optimization; Economic emission dispatch; Constraints handling; Hybrid multi-objective algorithm; Valve-point effect","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal PBSD methods provide different strategies to design the numerous variables, including strength, stiffness and ductility of each structural component. The overall goal of this study is to develop a new optimal PBSD method for multi-story RC moment frames. This method is capable of overcoming the deficiencies of existing optimal PBSD methods and can be implemented by the U.S. design practice. The proposed method minimizes construction cost and takes the limit of member plastic rotation and optionally inter-story drift as optimization constraints. Other seismic design requirements reflecting successful design practice are also incorporated. Simplification is made by reducing design variables into two, one for the overall system stiffness and the other for the overall system strength. The optimization contains two stages, the determination of feasible region boundary in normalized strength and stiffness domain and optimization in the material consumption domain. Capacity spectrum method, which jointly considers nonlinear static analysis and inelastic design spectrum, is used to estimate the global and local deformation demands at the peak dynamic response. The proposed optimization approach is applied to the design of a six-story four-bay reinforced concrete frame. The optimal design results indicate that 30% of needed flexural strength and 26% of the cross-sectional area can be reduced from the initial strength-based design of this prototype structure. Nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted on the optimized structure using ten historical ground motions scaled to represent three levels of seismic hazard. In general, the average peak dynamic response meets the target performance requirements under the three levels of seismic hazard. Structural reliability analyses are applied on the optimal structure, the original structure and other 26 structures with different overall system stiffness and strength. The effects on nonperformance probability are determined based on the nonperformance contours, which is generated based on the reliability analyses results of all the 28 structures. To ensure the probabilities of nonperformance due to either plastic hinge or inter-story drift rotation is lower than the limits of all three preselected performance levels, the prototype structure should be design based on the relative overall system stiffness larger than 0.84 and the relative overall system strength larger than 0.4. To ensure that the probabilities of nonperformance only due to plastic hinge is lower than the limits of all three preselected performance levels, the prototype structure should be design based on two cases of relative strength and relative stiffness: (1) the relative overall system stiffness is larger than 0.75 and the relative overall system strength is larger than 0.4, and (2) the relative overall system stiffness is larger than 0.65 and the relative overall system strength is larger than 0.45. To ensure that the probabilities of nonperformance only due to inter-story drift rotation is lower than the limits of all three preselected performance levels, a structure should be design based on the relative overall system stiffness larger than 0.85 and the relative overall system strength larger than 0.6.","","2022-05-05 18:33:24","2022-05-12 22:11:57","2022-05-05 18:33:24","","208","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor, United States","Inglês","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9781392053805","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\YESVVR73\Zhang and Link para o site externo - Performance-Based Economical Seismic Design of Mul.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Reliability; Optimal design; Performance-based design; Nonlinear static analysis; Frame; Reinforced concrete; Applied sciences","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we focused on the necessary constraints for making a transportation plan of designated waste, such as completion of transportation within working hours and prevention of overlapping arrival times of transportation vehicles, and made a basic formulation for deriving an optimal transportation plan by quantum annealing. We also formulated a cost function that can be used to recreate the operation plan when the plan is disturbed by delays that may occur during the execution of the transportation plan, and optimized the transportation plan assuming normal conditions and when delays occur.

We discuss how this is relevant to quantum annealing, but also many gate model algorithms such as VQE and QAOA. We theoretically show that for problems of practical interest for quantum computing and assuming only quadratic interactions are available between the binary variables, it is not possible to have a more efficient general encoding in terms of number of binary variables per discrete variable. We furthermore use a D-Wave Advantage 1.1 flux qubit quantum annealing computer to show that the dynamics effectively freeze later for a domain-wall encoding compared to a traditional one-hot encoding. This second result could help explain the dramatic performance improvement of domain wall over one hot which has been seen in a recent experiment on D-Wave hardware. This is an important result because usually problem encoding and the underlying physics are considered separately, our work suggests that considering them together may be a more useful paradigm. We argue that this experimental result is also likely to carry over to a number of other settings, we discuss how this has implications for gate-model and quantum-inspired algorithms.","2022-01-26","2022-05-03 15:40:34","2022-05-13 21:10:13","2022-05-03 15:40:34","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2108.12004","Comment: 15 pages, 16 figures, typo in metadata fixed in v2, referee requested changes in v3","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DFGUQMJ6\Berwald et al. - 2022 - Understanding domain-wall encoding theoretically a.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DAK5XSNH\2108.html","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To obtain noise-robust quantum computers, each logical qubit is equipped with hundreds or thousands of physical qubits. However, it is not possible to use memory-consuming techniques for current quantum devices having at most hundreds or thousands of physical qubits on their own. For specific problems, valid quantum states have a unique structure as in the case of Fock states and W states where the Hamming weight is fixed, and the evolution takes place in a smaller subspace of the full Hilbert space. With this preknowledge, some errors can be detected during the evolution of the circuit, by filtering the states not obeying the pattern through postselection. In this paper, we present mid-circuit postselection schemes for frequently used encodings such as one-hot, binary, gray, and domain-wall encoding. For the particular subspace of one-hot states, we propose a method that works by compressing the full Hilbert space to a smaller subspace, allowing projecting to the desired subspace without using any ancilla qubits. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach for the quantum alternating operator ansatz algorithm. Our method is particularly suitable for the currently available hardware, where measuring and resetting are possible, but classical conditional operators are not.","2022-02-28","2022-05-04 12:03:04","2022-05-13 21:08:00","2022-05-04 12:03:04","022441","","2","105","","Phys.

To address the dilemma, an efficient and economic hybrid storage and energy sharing model for multiple microgrids is proposed. Specificly, a hybrid energy storage system (HESS) is introduced, which contains an electrical battery and a heat storage tank and is able to realize energy conversion. The multiple microgrids can share energy through the HESS in a collaborative way. An energy optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall energy costs including energy purchase cost and HESS operating cost. ADMM algorithm is used to solve the problem in a distributed manner to avoid privacy concerns. The storage and energy sharing benefits of the microgrids and the HESS are determined by Nash bargaining solution. Simulation results show that the model can effectively improve the utilization of the renewable energy, and lead to considerable economic benefits for both the microgrids and the HESS.","2022-04-01","2022-05-03 17:32:08","2022-05-13 21:07:42","2022-05-03 17:32:07","123124","","","244","","Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RQWI6K2T\Cao et al. - 2022 - An efficient and economical storage and energy sha.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Energy sharing; Multi-energy microgrids; Nash bargaining; Storage sharing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An alternative to diminish the polluting emissions released by the generating units is the Emission Constrained Economic Dispatch (ECED). This is an optimization problem where the total fuel cost is minimized while treating emissions as a constraint with a pre-specified limit. Usually, the fuel cost and emission functions of the generating units must be experimentally derived, introducing then uncertainties in the obtained models. However, these uncertainties are often neglected and the ECED problem is solved considering the coefficients of the functions involved as exact (totally known) values. In this investigation we analyzed the effect of the uncertainties associated to the experimental derivation of the input–output curves of thermal power plants. Particularly, when polynomial models are fitted through multiple linear regression, we proposed an approach that, based on the respectively prediction intervals, can provide solutions immunized, in some sense, against variability in the coefficients estimates. We tested the proposed approach in a real system from the Chilean electrical power network. For the analyzed system we noted that, when uncertainties are not considered, the deterministic optimal solutions can be environmentally infeasible in some scenarios; whereas solutions obtained through the proposed approach, can significantly diminish the risk of environmental violations. The robustness of the prediction interval-based solutions was obtained with a negligible increase of the total fuel cost in all the cases studied.","2022","2022-05-11 15:50:22","2022-05-13 21:07:34","","119070","","","317","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\HM7SQ2ND\Carrillo-Galvez et al. - 2022 - Effect of models uncertainties on the emission con.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Environmental constrained economic dispatch; Multiple linear regression; Prediction interval","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Rational gate allocation is regarded as one of the most important means to solve this bottleneck. In this paper, in order to comprehensively considere different stakeholders, a three-objective gate allocation model is to consider a wider scope, in which the minimizing passenger walking distances, the most balanced idle time of each gate and the best full use of large gate are optimized simultaneously to improve the practical efficiency. To efficiently solve this model, an improved quantum evolutionary algorithm (QEA) based on the niche co-evolution strategy and enhanced particle swarm optimization (PSO), namely IPOQEA is designed. An IPOQEA-based gate allocation method is proposed to allocate the flights to suitable gates within different periods. Finally, the actual operation data of Baiyun Airport is used to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Comparison results show that the constructed model can address the passenger walking distances, robustness and costs in airport management. Moreover, the IPOQEA has better optimization ability in solving gate allocation problem. Therefore, the proposed gate allocation method has great potential for practical engineering since it can easily make decisions for airport managers.","2022-03","2022-05-04 10:25:25","2022-05-13 21:03:14","","1737-1745","","3","23","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\SD597D35\9210735.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AVL4TNSW\Deng et al. - 2022 - A Novel Gate Resource Allocation Method Using Impr.pdf","","included","Optimization; Logic gates; Resource management; Sociology; Statistics; Airports; Atmospheric modeling; Gate allocation model; improved rotation gates; multi-objective; niche co-evolution strategy; PSO; QEA","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In GSFPAFDS algorithm, the optimization problem is improved in several sub-problems. The pollination of flowers in the population is enhanced in Levy flight with fitness distance to enhance convergence. Therefore, the GSA can be used as a local search in FPA. This simulation is part of the traditional GSA, FPA, GSFPA, and personnel processing to solve the consequences of sequential global optimization problems. A local update strategy is used to increase optimization capacity. Its main objectives are to minimize the overall execution time and the allocation of the balance between local and global optimal zone. It allows global parallelization with the simultaneous performance of the processor to the functions, and determine the ratio of the communication to the functions.

Indeed, the runtime is not better than the Grover-Algorithm. We therefor withdraw this work. We present a novel algorithmic approach to find a proper vertex colouring of a graph with $d$ colours, if it exists. We associate a $d$-dimensional quantum system with each vertex and the initial state is a mixture of all possible colourings, from which we obtain a random proper colouring of the graph by measurements. The non-deterministic nature of the quantum measurement is tackled by a reset operation, which can revert the effect of unwanted projections. As in the classical case, we find that the runtime scales exponentially with the number of vertices. However, we provide numerical evidence that the average runtime of the problem-specific part of the algorithm scales polynomially in the number of edges.","2022-03-03","2022-05-04 10:16:30","2022-05-12 23:33:43","2022-05-04 10:16:30","","","","","","","Withdrawn","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2111.14390","Comment: We withdraw this work, because, in contrast to what previous versions of this document suggested, the proposed algorithm is not faster than state-of-the-art approaches","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2NJMTB3Z\2111.html","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

First, this paper constructs a new renewable hybrid energy power system, which is composed of wind turbine (WT), photovoltaic (PV), electric energy storage, hydrogen energy storage, electrolytic cell and hydrogen gas turbine (HGT). Secondly, the scheduling strategy considering the demand response (DR) is studied. In the economic evaluation, according to the typical and extreme situations of new energy power generation caused by weather factors, three scenarios are constructed for research. In the simulation analysis part, the YALMIP solver is used to call CPLEX based on MATLAB platform to solve the objective, and the optimal solution in the scheduling cycle is obtained. The results show that the scheduling strategy proposed in this paper can save 22.8% of the operating cost under the same conditions.

In today's world, energy and environmental problems are becoming more and more serious. Solving CEED problems can reduce costs, save energy, and reduce environmental pollution. By adopting the maximum/maximum price penalty factor, the multi-objective CEED optimization problem is transformed into a single objective optimization problem, and a probability distribution arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA) based on variable order penalty function was proposed to solve the CEED problem. The energy attenuation strategy was proposed to replace the variation trend of Math optimizer accelerated (MOA) in the original AOA, which better balances the exploration and exploitation of AOA. Five probability distribution functions, including exponential distribution, uniform distribution, normal distribution, beta distribution and gamma distribution, are used to replace a control parameterμ, so as to enhance its searching ability, improve the convergence speed, and enhance the ability to jump out of the local optimal. Based on the CEC-BC-2017 benchmark functions, the original AOA is compared with the five improved AOA to select the best improved strategy, and the effectiveness of the improved strategy is verified by simulation comparison with other intelligent optimization algorithms. In dealing with the constraint of CEED problem, five kinds of penalty functions with varying order were proposed, which are sine function, hyperbolic tangent function, arctangent function, V-type function and hyperbolic secant function, respectively, to replace the traditional fixed penalty function. The CEED problem with 6 units are selected and solved under the total demand of 150 MW, 175 MW, 200 MW and 225 MW respectively. The experimental results show that the AOA based on probability distribution is better than other optimization algorithms in solving CEED problems, and the variable order penalty strategy improves the solution quality and convergence speed compared with the fixed penalty strategy.","2022-06-15","2022-05-11 16:29:01","2022-05-12 23:31:14","2022-05-11 16:29:01","119061","","","316","","Applied Energy","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","Combined economic emission dispatch; Probability distribution; Arithmetic optimization algorithm; Variable order penalty function","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The MMPA increases the populations' effectiveness to reach the optimum fitness solution and this is helpful in cases of single- and bi-objective functions. The proposed MMPA has been mathematically assessed with twenty-eight 50-dimensional benchmarks of CEC2017.

Aiming at eliminating the negative effects on main steam temperature control caused by uncertainties factors and disturbances, a high performance LADRC based on a novel parameters optimization strategy, the simultaneous heat transfer search (SHTS) algorithm, is designed to deliver a stability, rapidity, and precision of control process. In the presented SHTS algorithm, all the three phases of heat transfer are randomly and parallel operated, providing a significant improvement towards the optimization performance. The proposed algorithm is first verified on various benchmark functions contrasted to state-of-the-art counterparts in performance validating, and then adopted in the parameter selection of LADRC in the main steam temperature control system.

The wind power penetration into conventional power grids may have definite security connotations because the availability of wind power has primarily relied on weather conditions. As a result, in economic load dispatch (ELD) that comprises of penetration of wind power, a sensible compromise between the system risks and operating costs is preferred. In this paper, the Levy Interior Search algorithm (LISA) was implemented to elucidate the multi-objective ELD problem, taking into account, the penetration of wind power. Here the operating cost and system risk were considered as objective functions. The best compromise solution was determined using the fuzzy membership approach. In this paper, two different strategies are implemented for LISA. The superiority and efficacy of LISA were demonstrated through its implementation on a modified IEEE 30-bus system. The application results revealed that the LISA algorithm employing strategy II is able to yield better results when compared to ISA, LISA Strategy I and other optimization algorithms.","2022","2022-05-04 14:37:43","2022-05-12 23:28:09","","47-65","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-981-16-2674-6_5","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These issues can be addressed by an optimal energy-hub based planning framework considering the synergistic effects under multiple uncertainties. The energy hub model is extended to analyze energy-level matching and source–load balance with time-varying coupling factors representing part-load characteristics. The optimization problem is formulated as a bi-level planning model with uncertainties evaluated by a two-stage global sensitivity analysis. The bi-level planning model determines the system structure and component sizing at the upper level and identifies the optimal operation strategy at the lower level by employing piecewise linearization of part-load characteristics of components involved. The global sensitivity analysis reduces model size with the elementary effect method, identifies the most influential uncertain parameters with a variance-based method. A case study in Beijing is demonstrated for the proposed methodology. The results show that the proposed method can effectively plan the integrated energy system considering sequential source–load matching with the rational scheduling strategy of components. The demand-side response influences the system configuration and renewable energy penetration.

This paper proposes a dynamic optimization model of bus route schedule based on bus Integrated Circuit Card (IC Card) data. The optimization variable is the departure frequency of the candidate lines. To solve the model, a dynamic departure interval optimization method based on improved Genetic Algorithm (GA) was designed under different decision preferences. The method includes the calibration of generalized cost functions for passengers and bus companies and grasps the characteristics of bus operating speed changes and the design of departure strategies under different decision preferences. The validity and applicability of the proposed method are verified by a numerical example. We mainly carried out the following work: (1) Dynamic analysis of the time dimension of the bus departure interval takes into account the changes in passenger time characteristics during peak periods. (2) Seven schemes of weight ratio of passenger waiting time cost and bus operation cost were designed, and the departure intervals with different benefit orientations of passengers and operators were discussed, respectively, so as to select the corresponding departure schemes for decision makers under different decision preferences. The results show that (1) the total cost of the 7 different weighting schemes is lower than the actual value by 6.90% to 18.20%; (2) when decision makers need to bias the weight to the bus company, the weight ratio α : β between passengers and bus company is 0.25 : 0.75 which works best. The frequency of departures has been reduced by 6, and at the same time, the total optimized cost is reduced by 18.2%; (3) when decision makers need to bias the weight to the passengers, the weight ratio α : β between the passengers and bus company is 0.75 : 0.25 which works best. The frequency of departures has been increased by 19, and at the same time, the total optimized cost is reduced by 17.7%; and (4) when decision makers consider passengers and bus companies equally, the weight ratio α : β between passengers and bus companies is 0.5 : 0.5, the optimization cost is the closest to the actual cost, the optimization cost is reduced by 6.9%, and the frequency of departures has been increased by 5. The results show that the model in this paper provides a new idea for the information mining of bus routes in the research based on the bus IC Card data and provides an effective tool for the management of different operation decision preferences.","2022-01-13","2022-05-04 14:25:54","2022-05-12 23:24:05","2022-05-04 14:25:54","e7064061","","","2022","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","www.hindawi.com","","Publisher: Hindawi","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\EGDY8Q6Q\Li et al. - 2022 - Dynamic Optimization of Bus Line Schedule in Commu.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VQCZU6I6\7064061.html","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In each iteration, HS generates a new solution under the harmony search consideration rate (HMCR) from harmony memory (HM). And the new solution is fine-tuned through a pitch adjustment rate (PAR). The basic HS obtains a random value from HM for each variable of a solution, and adjusts it in a fixed range. For the sake of improving its performance, we present an enhanced harmony search based on quantum mechanism (QEHS), which incorporates quantum concepts and differential mutation operation into the harmony search algorithm. QEHS reinforces the exploration and exploitation capability in search space, with the use of wave function from Schrödinger formula to express the harmony in HM. For reflecting the effectiveness of QEHS, simulations are carried on 30 benchmark functions from CEC2014. To manifest its feasibility, we compared the results of QEHS with that of other HS variants and some popular algorithms.

Therefore, the risk existing in the current financial market should be deeply explored under blockchain technology (BT) to ensure the functions of financial markets. The risk of financial markets is analyzed using machine learning (ML) and random forest (RF). First, the clustering method is introduced, and an example is given to illustrate the RF classification model. The collected data sets are divided into test sets and training sets, the corresponding rules are formulated and generated, and the branches of the decision tree (DT) are constructed according to the optimization principle. Finally, the steps of constructing the branches of DT are repeated until they are not continued. The results show that the three major industries of the regional economy account for 3.5%, 51.8%, 3.2%, 3.4%, and 3.8% of the regional GDP, respectively, the secondary industry makes up 44.5%, 43%, 45.1%, 44.8%, and 43.6%, respectively, and the tertiary industry occupies 20%, 3.7%, 52.3%, 52.9%, 54%, and 54.6%, respectively. This shows that with the development of the industrial structure under BT, the economic subject gradually shifts from the primary industry to the tertiary industry; BT can improve the efficiency of the financial industry and reduce operating costs and dependence on media. Meanwhile, the financial features of BT can provide a good platform for business expansion. The application of BT to the supply chain gives a theoretical reference for promoting the synergy between companies.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:22","2022-05-12 23:22:51","","31","","1","2022","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://jwcn-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13638-022-02117-3</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\FBTNMX36\Liu and Yu - 2022 - The analysis of financial market risk based on mac.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Machine learning; Blockchain; Clustering method; Financial market; Random forest","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Many researchers have attempted to improve particle swarm optimization (PSO) in the past decades; however, in solving the NCOPs, the PSO‐based approaches often cause premature convergences. The problem‐specific constraints frequently generate many infeasible regions that block the movements of particles. The particles' behavior causes the exploration abilities of particles that tend to weaken along with time. The decreasing of exploration ability often comes from the particle becoming stagnant or moving unusefully. This study proposes a neutrino‐like particle (NLP) with adaptive NLP hyperparameters that simulate the natural neutrino behavior. The proposed NLPs can be embedded in the PSO‐based approaches for overcoming premature convergence. The experiment results demonstrate that all referenced PSO‐based methods with the NLPs improved significantly compared with those without the NLPs to solve the NCOPs. All referenced PSO‐based methods that embedded the NLPs also significantly outperform four recent strong algorithms in most IEEE CEC 2020 benchmark problems. Therefore, the proposed NLPs with adaptive NLP hyperparameters can effectively solve the premature convergences, reinforce the exploration ability, and maintain the exploitation capability for solving the NCOPs over the whole evolution process.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:17","2022-05-12 23:21:28","","859-913","","1","37","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RKD8GK6F\Lu et al. - 2022 - Neutrino-like particle for particle swarm optimiza.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ZPUXNZWE\int.html","","excluded; not an application","particle swarm optimization; exploration; neutrino-like particle; nonlinear constrained optimization problems; premature convergances","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, investigation of previous proposed models reveals lack of a comprehensive review study to develop a dynamic multi storage model in energy hubs. In the present study, achievements for development of single- and multi-energy storage systems in energy hubs are reviewed and classified. Accordingly, different comparison tables are proposed for energy storage systems in energy hubs based on type of stored energy carriers. Also, techno-economic characteristics of recent energy storage models in literature are studied. Considering the energy storage facilities applicability, the present review research will add valuable data to the body of review investigations in this field. The results of this study revealed that there are some technical deficiencies for multi energy storage phenomena in hybrid energy systems. These include the technical advantages of interconnected storage, multi discharging capability and modeling real operational constraints of facilities.

However, it is still subject to debate whether quantum systems in the presence of decoherence are more useful than those using classical dynamics to drive computation. We contribute to this debate by introducing the perturbed ferromagnetic chain (PFC), a chain of frustrated sub-systems where the degree of frustration scales inversely with the perturbation introduced by a tunable parameter. This gives us an easily embeddable gadget whereby problem hardness can be tuned for systems of constant size. We outline the properties of the PFC and compare classical spin-vector Monte Carlo (SVMC) variants with the adiabatic quantum master equation. We demonstrate that SVMC methods get trapped in the exponentially large first-excited-state manifold when solving this frustrated problem, whereas evolution using quantum dynamics remains in the lowest energy eigenstates. This results in significant differences in ground state probability when using either classical or quantum annealing dynamics in the TFIM.","2022-02-10","2022-05-04 12:02:53","2022-05-12 23:16:00","2022-05-04 12:02:53","022410","","2","105","","Phys.

The study uses Adaptive Charging Network data to investigate a public and a workplace site for predicting individual charging station occupancy as well as overall site occupancy. Predicting individual charging point occupancy is formulated as a classification problem, while predicting total occupancy is formulated as a regression problem. The effects of different feature sets on the predictions are investigated, as well as whether a model trained on data of all charging points per site performs better than one trained on the data of a specific charging point. Reviewed studies so far, however, have failed to compare these two approaches to benchmarks, to use more than one algorithm, or to consider more than one site. Therefore, the following supervised machine-learning algorithms were applied for both tasks: linear and logistic regression, k-nearest neighbor, random forest, and XGBoost. Further, the model results are compared to three different naïve approaches which provide a robust benchmark, and the two training approaches were applied to two different sites. By adding features, the prediction quality can be increased considerably, which resulted in some models performing better than the naïve approaches. In general, models trained on data of all charging points of a site perform slightly better on median than models trained on individual charging points. In certain cases, however, individually trained models achieve the best results, while charging points with very low relative charging point occupancy can benefit from a model that has been trained on all data.","2022","2022-05-11 16:17:32","2022-05-12 23:15:46","","3409","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The algorithm considers in its optimization routine a hybrid system based on both the population and the trajectory, demonstrating a great capacity for exploration and exploitation since it distributes points to be evaluated in the objective function through a Lichtenberg figure that is shot in sizes and different rotations at each iteration. The Multi-objective Lichtenberg Algorithm (MOLA) is the first hybrid multi-objective meta-heuristic and was tested against traditional and recent meta-heuristics using famous and complex test function groups and also constrained complex engineering problems.

This gives rise to the need for conflict resolution advisory tools that can perform well in high-density traffic scenarios given a noisy environment. Unlike model-based approaches, learning-based approaches can take advantage of historical traffic data and flexibly encapsulate environmental uncertainty. In this study, we propose a reinforcement learning approach that is capable of resolving conflicts, in the presence of traffic and inherent uncertainties in conflict resolution maneuvers, without the need for prior knowledge about a set of rules mapping from conflict scenarios to expected actions. The conflict resolution task is formulated as a decision-making problem in a large and complex action space. The research also includes the development of a learning environment, scenario state representation, reward function, and a reinforcement learning algorithm inspired from Q-learning and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithms. The proposed algorithm, with two stages decision-making process, is used to train an agent that can serves as an advisory tool for air traffic controllers in resolving air traffic conflicts where it can learn from historical data by evolving overtime. Our findings show that the proposed model gives the agent the capability to suggest high quality conflict resolutions under different environmental conditions. It outperforms two baseline algorithms. The trained model has high performance under low uncertainty level (success rate ≥ 95 % ) and medium uncertainty level (success rate ≥ 87 % ) with high traffic density. The detailed analysis of different impact factors such as environment’s uncertainty and traffic density on learning performance are investigated and discussed. The environment’s uncertainty is the most important factor which affects the performance. Moreover, the combination of high-density traffic and high uncertainty will be the challenge for any learning models.","2022","2022-05-04 10:49:29","2022-05-12 23:15:32","","103463","","","135","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://hal-enac.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-03425669/file/TRC_DRL_Conflict_Resolution.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MAQFDMLC\Pham et al. - 2022 - Deep reinforcement learning based path stretch vec.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Reinforcement learning; Actor-critic; Air traffic control; Conflict resolution; Deep deterministic policy gradient; Learning environment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the particular way in which this penalization is carried out affects the value of the penalty parameters, as well as the number of additional binary variables that are needed to obtain the desired QUBO reformulation. In turn, these factors substantially affect the ability of quantum computers to efficiently solve these constrained COPT problems. This efficiency is the key toward the goal of using quantum computers to solve constrained COPT problems more efficiently than with classical computers. Along these lines, we consider an important constrained COPT problem, namely the maximum k-colorable subgraph (MkCS) problem, in which the aim is to find an induced k-colorable subgraph with maximum cardinality in a given graph. This problem arises in channel assignment in spectrum sharing networks, VLSI design, human genetic research, and cybersecurity. We derive two QUBO reformulations for the MkCS problem and fully characterize the range of the penalty parameters that can be used in the QUBO reformulations. Further, one of the QUBO reformulations of the MkCS problem is obtained without the need to introduce additional binary variables. To illustrate the benefits of obtaining and characterizing these QUBO reformulations, we benchmark different QUBO reformulations of the MkCS problem by performing numerical tests on D-Wave’s quantum annealing devices. These tests also illustrate the numerical power gained by using the latest D-Wave’s quantum annealing device.","2022-02-18","2022-05-04 10:46:24","2022-05-12 23:14:33","2022-05-04 10:46:24","89","","3","21","","Quantum Inf Process","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.09462</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2AD7ZVFL\Quintero et al. - 2022 - Characterization of QUBO reformulations for the ma.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Quantum Computing; Combinatorial Optimization; 68Q09; 68Q12; 81P68; 90C27; Chimera versus Pegasus D-Wave Annealer; NISQ devices; QUBO reformulations","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

After the BSSs are connected to MG, the batteries in the BSSs can offer auxiliary service to grid through the battery to grid (B2G) operation.

Renewable and non-renewable energy resources are used for power generation. In thermal units of power generation, the important thing is that efficient operational policies are required in these units, as increasing the power generating units is not only the solution to meet the load demands but essential to optimize the existing generating units effectively. Economic dispatch (ED) generating units are operating economically to fulfill the load demand and losses along with different practical constraints. In order to overcome the non-linear complex problems in power economic dispatch of thermal generating units, an advanced modified Levi Flight Firefly Algorithm (MLFA) is employed on various IEEE standard test systems for validation. The proposed technique/algorithm has been applied on 6, 13, 15, and 20 unit test systems considering various system constraints including valve loading effect, upper and lower limits, transmission losses, etc. In this research, an objective function is formulated on the flashing behavior of fireflies which optimizes the problems.

One is the primary product and the other is the updated version of that primary product. Due to continuous development in technology, the life-cycle of some high-tech products, like, smartphone, tablet, laptop, etc. have become shorter. We witness the launching of new products more frequently in this field. This prompts the manufacturers to release an updated or pro version of their existing products after a certain time to compete in the market. The reputation of the primary product (in terms of quality and performance) plays an important role in generating the demand for the updated product. Due to the short life-cycle of the products, the proposed model considers only two consecutive production runs. One for the primary product and one for the updated product. Here the demands of both the products depend on the respective selling prices. Moreover, the demand of the updated product is also dependent on the quality of the primary product. Shortages for the primary product are allowed. Those shortages are backlogged partially with the updated product. Also, the possibility of imperfect production during regular production runs is considered. The selling prices, production rates, and the production run times for both the products are considered here as decision variables. Due to the complexity in the resulting optimization problem, the quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization technique is applied to derive the optimal profit. The concavity natures of the profit function are shown graphically. A numerical illustration is presented for the economic validation of the model. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal solutions concerning the key inventory parameters is conducted for identifying several managerial implications.</p>","2022","2022-05-04 11:20:27","2022-05-12 23:14:15","2022-05-04 11:20:27","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.aimsciences.org","","Company: Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization Distributor: Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization Institution: Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization Label: Journal of Industrial and Management Optimization Publisher: American Institute of Mathematical Sciences","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RAJ8M67I\Ruidas et al. - 2022 - A production inventory model for high-tech product.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\GJ99JWL6\jimo.html","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A micro-energy hub (μEH) concept has recently been proposed in the integrated electricity and natural gas distribution systems (IENGDSs), for generating, converting, storing, and managing different types of energy at the customer level. To improve the performance of μEH, this paper proposes a hierarchical optimization-based model to optimize the sizes of μEH components and locations of μEHs in the IENGDS. The operation and structural sizing constraints of the μEHs are first determined. Then the optimal electricity network buses and natural gas nodes for installing μEHs are determined, considering the operational constraints of IENGDS. The objective in both steps is to minimize operation and investment costs. Moreover, the impacts of seasonal climate changes on energy demands and prices are considered during the planning horizon. Furthermore, the uncertainties in demands and renewable energy generation are quantified with a two-stage stochastic programming framework. The effectiveness of the proposed method is evaluated on an IENGDS that consists of an IEEE 33-bus distribution system and a Belgian 20-node natural gas system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the optimal hierarchical planning model can improve total line losses and reduce the total purchased electricity from the upstream network and total imported natural gas from gas wells. The simulation results show that if the hierarchical optimization process is not performed in determining optimal placement of μEHs, then IENGDS may operate with electricity network congestion or natural gas pressure violations during the planning horizon.","2022","2022-05-03 17:32:01","2022-05-12 23:12:00","","1-12","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Systems Journal","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\9GABY6E3\9687315.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\N67YXNNH\Seifossadat et al. - 2022 - Hierarchical Microenergy Hub Sizing and Placement .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Costs; Optimization; Planning; Resistance heating; Natural gas; Cogeneration; planning; Boilers; Integrated electricity and natural gas distribution systems (IENGDSs); microenergy hub; stochastic programming","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

If the exact power and heat demands are given, existing algorithms can be used to give a quick optimal solution to the economic dispatch problem. However, in practice, the power and heat demands cannot be known deterministically, but are rather predicted, resulting in an estimate and a bound on the estimation error. We consider the case in which the power and heat demands are unknown, and present a robust optimization-based approach for scheduling the turbine’s heat and power generation, in which the demand is assumed to be inside an uncertainty set. We consider two different choices of the uncertainty set relying on the ℓ ∞ - and the ℓ 1 -norms, each with different advantages, and consider the associated robust economic dispatch problems. We recast these as robust shortest-path problems on appropriately defined graphs. For the first choice, we provide an exact linear-time algorithm for the solution of the robust shortest-path problem, and for the second, we provide an exact quadratic-time algorithm and an approximate linear-time algorithm. The efficiency and usefulness of the algorithms are demonstrated using a detailed case study that employs real data on energy demand profiles and electricity tariffs.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:20","2022-05-12 23:08:01","","118391","","","309","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2021.118391</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\GLS5W4VV\Sharf et al. - 2022 - Economic dispatch of a single micro gas turbine un.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Robust optimization; Microgrids; Uncertain demand; Economic dispatch; Combined Heat and Power (CHP); Micro gas turbines","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This research presents a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) approach for optimizing a power system's daily operational cost while increasing its resilience, including a wind turbine, battery, and conventional grid. Deep learning and statistical models along with a novel hybrid model, were developed and used to forecast the 3 days ahead load demand and wind power output. Testing these models shows that the proposed hybrid model could predict load with more accuracy than other models and it could reduce the root mean squared error by 22% to 44% for load forecasting and by 10.5% to 16.6% for wind speed prediction. The MILP model is applied for optimizing the load dispatch of an urban microgrid. The results of the dispatching model show that adding battery storage not only can bring down the grid-connected daily operational cost (from $8.4/day cost to $109.8/day income) and increase the resilience of the system by providing an off-grid mode, but also can extend its lifetime through minimization of degradation cost. The results also indicate that the degradation cost of batteries will contribute to a bigger portion of the operational costs in an off-grid mode in comparison to that of wind power curtailment cost. This research can inform effective and logical decisions for urban micro-grids and direct better integration and use of renewable energy systems in urban areas.","2022","2022-05-03 15:56:55","2022-05-12 23:07:57","2022-05-03 15:56:55","3173-3188","","3","46","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/er.7374","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\S3HZ3NZW\Shirzadi et al. - 2022 - Optimal dispatching of renewable energy-based urba.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8UWDLNXP\er.html","","excluded; not an application","energy storage; microgrid; mixed integer programming; optimal dispatching; renewable energies; resilience; unit commitment; wind curtailment","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Motivated by the fact that most libraries present their benchmark instances in terms of adjacency matrices, we develop a novel matrix formulation for the HCP and TSP Hamiltonians, which enables the seamless and automatic integration of benchmark instances in quantum platforms. We also present a thorough mathematical analysis of the precise number of constraints required to express the HCP and TSP Hamiltonians. This analysis explains quantitatively why, almost always, running incomplete graph instances requires more qubits than complete instances. It turns out that QUBO models for incomplete graphs require more quadratic constraints than complete graphs, a fact that has been corroborated by a series of experiments. Moreover, we introduce a technique for the min-max normalization for the coefficients of the TSP Hamiltonian to address the problem of invalid solutions produced by the quantum annealer, a trend often observed. Our extensive experimental tests have demonstrated that the D-Wave Advantage_system4.1 is more efficient than the Advantage_system1.1, both in terms of qubit utilization and the quality of solutions.

We provide several new ZX-diagram rewrite rules and generalizations for this setting. In particular, we give formal rules for dealing with linear combinations of ZX-diagrams, where the relative complex-valued scale factors of each diagram must be kept track of, in contrast to most previously studied single-diagram realizations where these coefficients can be effectively ignored. This allows us to directly import a number useful relations from the operator analysis to ZX-calculus setting, including causal cone and quantum gate commutation rules.

Therefore, it is very essential to generate electricity with the lowest possible cost and emission. A review of previous research shows that evolutionary and swarm intelligence-based optimization algorithms have been used to solve combined economic emission dispatch problems to reduce the cost of electricity generation and emission simultaneously. However, most research work reported in past gives either inferior optimal solutions or best solutions at the cost of constraint violation. In this paper, a multi-objective optimization problem, to reduce the cost of electricity generation and emission simultaneously is proposed. The algorithm is a combination of a modified artificial bee colony algorithm (MOABC) and a non-dominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). To validate the effectiveness of the proposed, MOABC-NSGA-II algorithm, it is applied to three test systems consisting of 6, 10, and 40 unit thermal units. It is found that the proposed algorithm gives the best results compared to the results presented in previous literature in terms of best fuel cost and best emission value. To be able to compare the best compromising solution obtained by the proposed algorithm with previously published articles, sixteen different multi-attribute decision-making algorithms are used to identify the best non-dominated solutions. It has been shown that the proposed algorithm gives better results without violating constraints with the minimum number of iterations.","2022-03-30","2022-05-03 17:00:06","2022-05-12 23:02:42","2022-05-03 17:00:06","","","","","","","","","","","","Social Science Research Network","Rochester, NY","en","","SSRN Scholarly Paper","","","papers.ssrn.com","","DOI: 10.2139/ssrn.4070520","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\G72MEWJF\Sutar and Jadhav - 2022 - A Modified Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm Based o.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UTQFPZRE\papers.html","","excluded; not an application","optimization; NSGA-II; artificial bee colony; Economic Emission dispatch; multi-attribute decision making; Pareto optimal","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","4070520","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent studies manifest the importance of efficiently solving well- and ill-conditioned Power-Flow cases in a modern power-system paradigm. While the well-conditioned cases are easily solvable using standard methods, the ill-conditioned ones suppose a challenge for such solvers. In this regard, methods based on the Continuous Newton’s principle have demonstrated their ability to address ill-conditioned cases with acceptable efficiency. This paper demonstrates that the approaches proposed so far do not extract the best numerical properties of such solvers. To fill this gap, an optimization framework is proposed by which the parameters involved in the two-stage Runge–Kutta-based solvers are appropriately set, so that the stability and convergence order of the numerical mapping are maximized. By using the developed optimization technique, three solvers with quadratic, cubic, and 4th order of convergence are developed. The new proposals are tested on a variety of large-scale ill-conditioned cases.

Both the cost of fuel and the emission pollution caused by it must be kept to a minimum. As a result, this paper presents an innovative hybrid approach (ihPSODE) for solving CEED problems. This hybrid technique incorporated novel differential evolution (nDE) and particle swarm optimization (nPSO). Where nDE introduces a new mutation approach and crossover rate (to prevent premature convergence) as well as nPSO introduces a new acceleration coefficient, inertia weight and position improve equation (to alleviate the stagnation).

This paper investigates the two-stage robust optimization (RO) of hybrid energy integration regarding wind volatility. In RO method, the WT output is modeled with an uncertainty budget, which represents the degree of conservatism. Simulation results validate that when the uncertainty budget rises to a maximal value, ESS degradation cost increases 25.7%, and total cost decreases 2.0%. Additionally, demand response program (DRP) exhibits elastic and voluntary merits. With the implementation of DRP, 6139.9$ total savings are achieved compared with the ordinary RO method. Meanwhile, the merits of stochastic optimization (SO) have also been studied. Despite the ESS degradation cost and total cost in SO being lower than those in RO, SO requires accurate probability distribution of uncertain variables in real situations.

In addition, renewable energy curtailment in the power distribution system, as well as low efficiency due to independent operation of traditional energy systems, has been addressed by the application of integrated energy system (IES) to some extent. In this paper, we propose a planning method for low-carbon building-level IES, in which electric vehicles (EV) and the mode of Vehicle to Grid (V2G) are considered and further increase the flexibility of low-carbon buildings. The proposed planning model optimize the investment, operation costs and CO2 emission for building-level IES, so as to achieve the maximum benefit of the construction of the low-carbon building and help the realization of carbon neutrality. Moreover, we consider the uncertainty of distributed renewable energy, multi-energy load fluctuation and the random behavior of EV users, then formulating a two-stage stochastic programming model with chance constraints, in which heuristic moment matching scenario generation (HMMSG) and sample average approximation (SAA) method are applied. In case study, a real IES commercial building in Shanghai, where photovoltaic (PV), energy storage system (ESS), fuel cell (FC), EV, etc. are included as planning options, is used as numerical example to verify the effectiveness of the proposed planning method, with functions of ESS and EV in IES are analyzed in detail in different operation scenarios.","2022-03-21","2022-05-03 17:32:25","2022-05-12 23:01:50","2022-05-03 17:32:25","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2203.10799","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RVEC5Q9Q\Xiong et al. - 2022 - A Stochastic Planning Method for Low-carbon Buildi.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\6BD253F8\2203.html","","excluded; not an application","Electrical Engineering and Systems Science - Systems and Control","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, a Dynamically adjusted Space Contraction based on the Adaptive Tradeoff Model and Adaptive Evolutionary Strategy (DSC-ATM-AES) has been proposed to solve ED problems. This algorithm proposes a definition for the Differential Variance (DV) and self-adaptive slack F to enhance the searching capacity of Evolutionary Strategy (ES). It also introduces a Space Contraction (SC) technique and further improves it. The algorithm is tested on various ED problems (including 6,11,13, and 40 generators), namely standard ED problems and ED problems with valve-point effects.

The objective function minimizes the expected operational cost (EOC) by reducing the imported electricity from the power grid and increasing exported electricity/hydrogen to non-residential vehicles. Additionally, the demand response program (DRP) is applied in the residential load to achieve operational cost reduction. The uncertainties are modeled via various scenarios by using scenario-based stochastic optimization method. Notably, existing research for similar frameworks both lacks the consideration of uncertainties and DRP, and fails to distinguish the residential and non-residential vehicles with different charging behaviors.

The algorithm is designed by modifying the recently presented hybrid PSO and BA (HPSOBA) algorithm applied for the achievement of the optimal solution of the EDPs. The modified algorithm is implemented to solve EDPs of all RESs-based power systems for three scenarios, without constraints, with time-varying demand, and with the consideration of regional load sharing dispatch (RLSD). The performance of the algorithm is also verified through the implementation of various combinations of hybrid as well as thermal power plants (TPPs). The case of TPPs consists of three different scenarios: 1) a small-scale system with constraints like ramp-rate limits (RRLs), prohibited operating zones (POZs), and power losses; 2) a medium-scale power system with consideration of emission-economic dispatch (EED); 3) a large-scale power system with valve-point loading (VPL) effect.

To impose this concept for increasing efficiency of the genetic algorithm (GA), first, engineered populations are generated, and then linear analysis of the structure is performed to check some of the constraints, finally in the case of satisfying the first stage constraints, nonlinear static analysis is carried out.

To calculate the LCF damage index for SMFs, the Palmgren-Miner’s rule is applied on the history of relative drift of the stories based on non-linear response history analysis and existing experimental fatigue curves. On the other hand, repeated earthquakes strongly affect the inelastic response of structures and can increase building vulnerability. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to numerically assess the mainshock-aftershock LCF damage index for performance-based optimally designed SMFs. Two illustrative design examples of 6- and 12-story SMFs are presented and designed for optimal initial and total costs in the context of performance-based design. The LCF damage index is evaluated for these structures by conducting nonlinear response-history analysis for a suite of real strong multiple earthquakes. The results showed that the optimally designed SMFs are highly vulnerable against LCF damage due to mainshock-aftershock seismic sequences. Subsequently, a simple procedure is proposed to increase the safety of optimally designed SMFs against the LCF damage. To this end, performance-based optimization process is performed for 6- and 12-story SMFs by considering higher seismic confidence levels and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy in controlling the LCF damage of SMFs caused by seismic sequences.","2021-06-15","2022-05-05 18:23:08","2022-05-15 16:40:45","2022-05-05 18:23:08","112207","","","237","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\IQKWBAY5\Ghaderi and Gholizadeh - 2021 - Mainshock–aftershock low-cycle fatigue damage eval.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Structural optimization; Performance-based design; Low-cycle fatigue damage; Mainshock-aftershock sequence; Steel moment frame","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Optimal use of renewable energy sources (RESs) is an effective way to achieve these goals. In this regard, in this research article, an improved multi-objective differential evolutionary (IMODE) optimization algorithm is suggested and performed to dispatch electricity generations in a smart microgrid (MG) system, taking into account economy and emission as competitive issues. In this paper, a nonlinear equation of multi-objective optimization issue with various equality and inequality limitations is formulated in order to lower the total operational costs of the MG considering environmental pollution effects simultaneously. In order to address the issue of optimal operation of the MG in single-objective and multi-objective forms, an intelligent method according to the improved differential evolutionary (IDE) optimization is utilized and performed and the proposed algorithm is implemented on different problems. First, it is assumed that there is no limit to the exchange of power overhead, and secondly, the limitation of power exchange with the upstream grid is considered. In multi-objective mode, these two modes are also considered. In order to show the impact of renewable energy on the cost, in the third part of the simulations, the operation is solved with maximum participation of renewable energy sources. In the final section, the sensitivity analysis on the number of populations in this problem is performed. The obtained results of the simulation are compared to differential evolutionary (DE) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) techniques.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:13","2022-05-15 16:40:04","","125769","","","597","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\IUR5G3PH\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf","","included","Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The introduction of demand response mechanism guided by market factors in the optimization of regional integrated energy system (RIES) has become an inevitable trend. Based on the coupling characteristics of heterogeneous energy flow in regional integrated energy system and the response potential of flexible load on the user side, the concept of demand response (DR) in electricity market is extended to cooling and heat in energy system, and an optimal operation planning method of RIES considering demand response is proposed in this paper. In order to solve the problem that the existing evaluation system of energy system is not comprehensive, this paper constructs a regional integrated energy system model considering demand response, which takes the optimal comprehensive evaluation index consisting of economic benefits of both supply side and user side, load peak valley ratio and carbon emission as the objective function. Then, an improved genetic optimization algorithm is used to solve the model, obtaining the optimization results of load demand response and energy networks, which specifically includes the equipment installed capacity, hourly output as well as operation strategy. Finally, an industrial park in Guangzhou is selected for case study. The result shows that user-side demand response reduces the total cost of regional integrated energy system by 5.17% and the peak-to-valley ratio of electric load by 59.9%, which plays a role in cutting peak and filling valley in the energy system.","2021-06-05","2022-05-03 17:17:46","2022-05-15 16:39:50","2022-05-03 17:17:46","116860","","","191","","Applied Thermal Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TF35NVVH\Guo et al. - 2021 - Optimal operation of regional integrated energy sy.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Demand response; Regional integrated energy system; Multi-objective optimization; Energy supply side; Operation strategy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our framework relates quantum cost gradient operators, derived from the cost and mixing Hamiltonians, to classical cost difference functions that reflect cost function neighborhood structure. By considering QAOA circuits from the Heisenberg picture, we derive exact general expressions for expectation values as series expansions in the algorithm parameters, cost gradient operators, and cost difference functions. This enables novel interpretability and insight into QAOA behavior in various parameter regimes. For single- level QAOA1 we show the leading-order changes in the output probabilities and cost expectation value explicitly in terms of classical cost differences, for arbitrary cost functions. This demonstrates that, for sufficiently small positive parameters, probability flows from lower to higher cost states on average. By selecting signs of the parameters, we can control the direction of flow. We use these results to derive a classical random algorithm emulating QAOA1 in the small-parameter regime, i.e., that produces bitstring samples with the same probabilities as QAOA1 up to small error. For deeper QAOAp circuits we apply our framework to derive analogous and additional results in several settings. In particular we show QAOA always beats random guessing. We describe how our framework incorporates cost Hamiltonian locality for specific problem classes, including causal cone approaches, and applies to QAOA performance analysis with arbitrary parameters. We illuminate our results with a number of examples including applications to QUBO problems, MaxCut, and variants of MaxSat.

Thus, this paper represents a multi-objective assessment for the operation of a multi-carrier microgrid (MCMG) in the presence of high-efficiency technologies comprising compressed air energy storage (CAES) and power-to-gas (P2G) systems. The objective of the model is to minimize the operation cost and environmental pollution. CAES has a simple-cycle mode operation besides the charging and discharging modes to provide more flexibility in the system. Furthermore, the demand response program is employed in the model to mitigate the peaks. The proposed system participates in both electricity and gas markets to supply the energy requirements. The weighted sum approach and fuzzy-based decision-making are employed to compromise the optimum solutions for conflicting objective functions. The multi-objective model is examined on a sample system, and the results for different cases are discussed.

In this paper, an elegant approach based on MRFO integrated with Gradient-Based Optimizer (GBO), named MRFO–GBO, is proposed to efficiently solve the economic emission dispatch (EED) problems. The proposed MRFO–GBO aims to reduce the probability of original MRFO to get trapped into local optima as well as accelerate the solution process. The goal of solving optimal Economic Emission Dispatch (EED) is to economically provide all required electrical loads as well as minimizing the emission with satisfying the operating equality and inequality constraints. Single and multi-objective EED problems are solved using the proposed MRFO–GBO and classical MRFO. In multi-objective EED, fuzzy set theory is adapted to determine the best compromise solution among Pareto optimal solutions. The proposed algorithm is firstly validated through well-known CEC’17 test functions, and then applied for solving several scenarios of EED problems for three electrical systems with 3-generators, 5-generators, and 6-generators.

ISMA is developed to improve the performance of the conventional Slime Mould Algorithm (SMA). In ISMA, the solution positions are updated depending on two equations borrowed from the sine–cosine algorithm (SCA) to obtain the best solution. Multi-objective SMA (MOSMA) and Multi-objective ISMA (MOISMA) are developed based on the Pareto dominance concept and fuzzy decision-making. In the multi-objective EED problem, MOSMA and MOISMA are applied to minimize the total fuel costs and total emission with the valve point effect simultaneously. The proposed single-and bi-objective economic emission dispatch algorithms are validated using five test systems, 6-units, 10-units, 11-units, 40-units, and 110-units. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with Harris Hawk Optimizer (HHO), JellyfishSearch optimizer (JS), Tunicate Swarm Algorithm (TSA), Particle swarm optimization (PSO), and SMA algorithms. The results show that the proposed algorithms are more robust than other well-known algorithms. Feasible solutions using the proposed algorithms are also achieved, which adjust the schedule of generation without violation of the operating generation limits.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:15","2022-05-15 16:16:46","","115205","","","182","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\9CGHVGNT\Hassan et al. - 2021 - Development and application of slime mould algorit.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Greenhouse gases; Valve point loading; Economic and emission dispatch; ISMA; Slime mould algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Here, the Combined Economic Emission Dispatch (CEED) problem is represented using a max/max Price Penalty Factor (PPF) to confine the system's nonlinearity. PPF is considered to transform a four-objective problem into a single-objective optimization problem. The proposed modification of AEO raises the effectiveness of the populations to achieve the best fitness solution by well-known 10 chaotic functions and this is valuable in both cases of the single and multi-objective functions. The CAEO algorithm is used for minimizing the economic load dispatch and the three bad gas emissions which are sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrous oxide (NOx), and carbon dioxide (CO2). To evaluate the proposed CAEO, it is utilized for four different levels of demand in a 6-unit power generation (30-bus test system) and 11-unit power generation (69-bus test system) with a different value of load demand (1000, 1500, 2000, and 2500MW). Statistical analysis is executed to estimate the reliability and stability of the proposed CAEO method. The results obtained by CAEO algorithm are compared with other methods and conventional AEO to prove that the modification is to boost the search strength of conventional AEO. The results display that the CAEO algorithm is superior to the conventional AEO and the others in achieving the best solution to the problem of CEED in terms of efficient results, strength, and computational capability all over study cases. In the second scenario of the bi-objective problem, the Pareto theory is integrated with a CAEO to get a series of Non-Dominated (ND) solutions, and then using the fuzzy approach to determine BCS.","2021","2022-05-11 15:43:38","2022-05-15 16:16:39","","51146-51165","","","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","<p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3066914</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MFBDVDI7\9380276.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\I9V3LXT6\Hassan et al. - 2021 - Developing Chaotic Artificial Ecosystem-Based Opti.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Reliability; Optimization; Genetic algorithms; Economics; Fuels; Power generation; Pareto front; artificial ecosystem-based optimization; chaotic AEO; Combined economic and emission dispatch; greenhouse gases; Licenses; price penalty factor","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this chapter the characteristics and challenges of economic dispatch in smart grids and microgrids and the development of artificial intelligence technologies especially machine learning methods are analyzed and discussed. The conventional economic dispatch frameworks are based on optimization methods that can model the economic dispatch problem as a convex optimization problem. Due to the centralized nature of such methods, challenges such as high communication cost and single point of failure emerge, which can be catered using decentralized and distributed methods based on multiagent systems and specialized machine learning methods such as reinforcement learning.

The D-Wave 2000 $Q$ is a quantum annealer that can solve 2048-bit sparse QUBO instances represented as a Chimera graph topology. We present a sparse QUBO solver running on GPUs for 2048-bit sparse QUBO with a Chimera graph topology. We have evaluated the performance of our sparse QUBO solver and the D-Wave 2000Q for solving 2048-bit QUBO instances with various resolutions. The experimental results show that our sparse QUBO solver running on a GPU cloud server with 8 NVIDIA A100 GPUs can find optimal solutions in less than 3ms for all instances while the D-Wave 2000 $Q$ cannot find them in 996.7ms. Hence, our QUBO solver can find better solutions than the D-Wave 2000Q in less than 1/300 running time. We can think that our QUBO solver is a quantum annealer simulator with better performance in terms of the accuracy of solutions and the running time. Our result implies that quantum annealer D-Wave 2000 $Q$ does not achieve quantum supremacy yet.","2021","2022-05-11 16:36:28","2022-05-15 15:46:53","","19-28","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method is a new version of the previously developed algorithm; namely, the elephant herding optimization (EHO). While the EHO algorithm has been inspired by the behavior of elephants, the theory behind this method is based on the herding behavior of the elephants, and also the selection of random members to replace the worst members, which is far from the real-life behavior of this animal. Since elephants are animals with powerful memories and a high capability for learning, it seems that by accurately modeling the real-life behavior of this animal, a more powerful algorithm can be developed. The proposed ECO algorithm attempts to simulate the most essential individual and collective behaviors of elephants. The performance of the ECO method is evaluated by solving several structural optimization problems, including the size optimization of truss structures. The findings of the study confirm the reliable performance of the proposed ECO algorithm to expedite the convergence rate and achieve superior solutions in comparison with the EHO. Moreover, the ECO method produces better or very competitive results by consuming less computational effort compared to well-known metaheuristic methods.","2021-12-01","2022-05-05 18:22:12","2022-05-15 15:45:34","2022-05-05 18:22:12","107892","","","113","","Applied Soft Computing","Elephant clan optimization","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\B5QTHISR\Jafari et al. - 2021 - Elephant clan optimization A nature-inspired meta.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\QJESAVU9\S1568494621008140.html","","excluded; not an application","Structural optimization; Elephant clan optimization; Elephant herding optimization; Truss structures","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, the geometric and material nonlinear behaviors are directly considered in the design of space structures so that the resulting designs are economical while having appropriate collapse behavior. Weight and collapse energy are considered the objective functions, and the problem is considered as a multi-objective optimization problem. This is the first attempt to combine the weight and collapse energy simultaneously for the optimal design of structures. To solve such problems, two new multi-objective algorithms based on the recently introduced crow search algorithm (CSA) have been proposed. These algorithms are called multi-objective crow search algorithm (MOCSA) and multi-objective modified crow search algorithm (MOMCSA). MOCSA and MOMCSA have similar structures and details, except that the MOCSA generates the new solution as the CSA approach does while generating the new solution in the MOMCSA is modified. The modification of the search vector and the search range is employed as two simple and effective changes in MOMCSA to enhance the exploration and exploitation. To evaluate the proposed algorithms, three space structures were optimized using the proposed algorithms and two well-known algorithms, MOPSO and NSGA-II. The results indicate superiority of MOMCSA to the other algorithms.","2021-02-14","2022-05-05 18:23:13","2022-05-15 15:45:20","2022-05-05 18:23:13","","","","","","Engineering with Computers","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\XWFHPQNL\Javidi et al. - 2021 - Optimization of weight and collapse energy of spac.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Multi-objective; Evolutionary algorithm; Truss structures; Nonlinear analysis","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The shift from large fossil-fuel based power systems to many small-scale distributed renewable energy systems is a favourable paradigm for a transition to the Energy Internet. Relying on wide spectrum of emerging technologies such as information & communication technologies, the Energy Internet facilitates real-time trade of power through bidirectional flows of electricity, communication, and money. Energy transitions in India are at a fast pace and further transformation to an Energy Internet is an achievable dream. Current structure of expedited energy transition is experienced in the form of transformation in business models of energy utility service companies and energy markets. The objective of this paper is to systematically assess the ongoing transitions, the challenges and the opportunities and examine whether India is ready to leapfrog into a new way of energy transactions which will gradually transform the present electricity system to an Energy Internet. Our findings elaborate a reality check on India’s current transition pathways and answer the question: can an Energy Internet become real in near future?","2021","2022-05-04 12:26:08","2022-05-15 15:45:02","","012001","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2634-4505/ac005d/pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The quantum processing unit by D-Wave is constructed to approximately solve Ising models on so-called Chimera graphs. Ising models are equivalent to quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problems and maximum cut problems on the associated graphs. We have tailored branch-and-cut as well as semidefinite programming algorithms for solving Ising models for Chimera graphs to provable optimality and use the strength of these approaches for comparing our solution values to those obtained on the current quantum annealing machine, D-Wave 2000Q. This allows for the assessment of the quality of solutions produced by the D-Wave hardware. In addition, we also evaluate the performance of a heuristic by Selby. It has been a matter of discussion in the literature how well the D-Wave hardware performs at its native task, and our experiments shed some more light on this issue. In particular, we examine how reliably the D-Wave computer can deliver true optimum solutions and present some surprising results.","2021-07-09","2022-05-04 10:36:00","2022-05-15 15:44:55","2022-05-04 10:36:00","1.9:1–1.9:30","","","26","","ACM J.

The WMA algorithm is a novel metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the mating behavior of woodpeckers and sound intensity (a physical quantity). The WMA is implemented on six test systems of different operational dimensions and characteristics to show its capacity for solving the ED problem.

Krill Herd Algorithm (KHA) is a meta-heuristic technique of swarm intelligence based on populations of krill individuals and its motion for searching food. To improve the convergence characteristics of KHA, it is combined with a confined selective operator, termed as the Hybrid Krill Herd Optimizer (HKHO). In this technique, the krill’s position is upgraded with confined krill individuals instead of the arbitrarily chosen individuals as processed in basic KHA. This proposed HKHO technique prevents entrapping of best possible solution in confined optima which means, it avoids the premature convergence of optimal solutions. A non-interactive multi-objective optimization technique is applied whereby the price penalty factor is applied to get scalar objective optimization in case of EEPD problem. The HKHO is implemented in small and medium standard test systems to show the applicability to solve EEPD problem. The developed optimizer is applied to validate the results on two power systems consisted of 6- and 40- thermal units. It gives 2.27% savings in fuel cost and 13.3 % reduction in emission of pollutants for 6-thermal units’ power systems with respects to the results undertaken for comparison. Whereas, 40-units’ power system, depicts the conflicting nature of the objectives, when the fuel cost is decreased by 0.16% and emission of pollutants decreases by 0.04%. In both the cases, the achieved results are comparable to already published work in terms of fuel cost and emission of pollutants as shown in tables of comparative analysis of achieved results. The examination of the results shows the satisfactory improvement in best possible solution.","2021-12-31","2022-05-03 17:14:20","2022-05-15 15:42:18","","1568-1584","","","8","","International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\M6U43867\Kaur et al. - 2021 - Hybrid krill herd optimizer for thermal power sche.pdf; ","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lakhwinder-Singh/publication/357474528_Hybrid_krill_herd_optimizer_for_thermal_power_scheduling_problem/links/61f2b9a28d338833e39bae28/Hybrid-krill-herd-optimizer-for-thermal-power-scheduling-problem.pdf","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Recent empirical studies have demonstrated that there is a significant correlation between architectural ""smells""—manifestations of architectural decay—and implementation issues. In this paper, we take a step further in exploring this phenomenon. We analyze the available development data from 10 open-source software systems and show that information regarding current architectural decay in these systems can be used to build models that accurately predict future issue-proneness and change-proneness of the systems’ implementations. As a less intuitive result, we also show that, in cases where historical data for a system is unavailable, such data from other, unrelated systems can provide reasonably accurate issue- and change-proneness prediction capabilities.","2021","2022-05-04 12:38:45","2022-05-15 15:31:03","","92-103","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.09835</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The DEED optimization target is to reduce the fuel cost and pollutant emission of the power system. In addition, DEED is a complex optimization problem and contains multiple optimization goals. To strengthen the ability of the ITSA algorithm for solving DEED, the tent mapping is employed to generate initial population for improving the directionality in the optimization process. Meanwhile, the gray wolf optimizer is used to generate the global search vector for improving global exploration ability, and the Levy flight is introduced to expand the search range. Three test systems containing 5, 10 and 15 generator units are employed to verify the solving performance of ITSA.

Most hard real-world problems exhibit a strong connectivity. For the worst-case scenario of a complete graph, there exists an efficient solution for the embedding into the ideal Chimera graph. However, since real machines almost always have broken qubits, it is necessary to find an embedding into the broken hardware graph. We present a new approach to the problem of embedding complete graphs into broken Chimera graphs. This problem can be formulated as an optimization problem, more precisely as a matching problem with additional linear constraints. Although being NP-hard in general, it is fixed-parameter tractable in the number of inaccessible vertices in the Chimera graph. We tested our exact approach on various instances of broken hardware graphs, both related to real hardware and randomly generated. For fixed runtime, we were able to embed larger complete graphs compared to previous, heuristic approaches. As an extension, we developed a fast heuristic algorithm which enables us to solve even larger instances.

Owing to the random and complex nature of WSNs, development and use of improved metaheuristic algorithms in CBF is of essence. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is a good candidate for use in CBF owing to its simplicity and low computation complexity. However, the basic PSO algorithm suffers from premature convergence particularly in highly multimodal functions (typical of CBF). This paper delves into the development and application of an improved Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm in CBF. A new fuzzy-logic based confidence and inertia weight parameters adaptation scheme has been developed with an aim of enhancing exploration and exploitation capabilities of the PSO algorithm. Normalized particle quality and iteration count have been used as the inputs to the designed fuzzy-logic inference system. The fuzzy logic based parameters adaptation scheme has been implemented in the form of a lookup table to minimize ""on-line"" computation complexity. Furthermore, a particle culling/ re-initialization procedure is utilized at half the number of maximum iterations to enhance overall swarm diversity. The modified PSO algorithm has been christened Culled Fuzzy Adaptive Particle Swarm Optimization (CFAPSO) algorithm. The developed CFAPSO algorithm is noted to outperform other metaheuristic algorithms in a statistical performance analysis procedure (on the basis of a set of standard unimodal and multimodal functions). Upon application to CBF, the CFAPSO algorithm is found to generate a beamsteering outcome statistically identical to that of conventional beamsteering.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:18","2022-05-13 22:49:50","","e08247","","10","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844021023501/pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\NLRQCK8B\Maina et al. - 2021 - Collaborative beamforming in wireless sensor netwo.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Particle swarm optimization; Beamsteering; Collaborative beamforming; Wireless sensor network","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To verify validity and capability of the ESOS algorithm in solving general optimization problems, the CEC2014 set of 22 benchmark functions is first optimized and the results are compared with other metaheuristic algorithms. The ESOS algorithm is then used to optimize the sizing and shape of five benchmark trusses with multiple frequency constraints. The best (minimum) mass, mean mass, standard deviation of the mass, total number of function evaluations, and the values of frequency constraints are then compared with those of a number of other metaheuristic solutions available in the literature.

The first two stages of this model are two-phase production periods with different production rates and the same demand rate. The third stage is the period after inventory build-up, before deterioration sets in with quadratic time demand rate while the fourth stage is the deterioration period with stock dependent demand rate. It is assumed that back-order is not allowed. At first, this paper shows the impact of change in production rate on cycle length that minimizes the total variable cost per unit time and economic production quantity. Then, a theorem and lemmas are provided to characterize the optimal analytical solutions. A numerical example is given to reveal the applicability of the model developed and sensitivity analysis is carried out to show the effect of change of some system parameter values on the total variable cost and economic production quantity obtained in the numerical example. Suggestions and recommendations are also presented toward reducing the total variable cost while maximizing the profit of an imperfect production cycle with unstable production rate. Finally, it is shown that the developed model improves upon that of the working paper.","2021","2022-05-04 11:20:49","2022-05-13 22:49:22","","351-380","","","","","","","Springer Proceedings in Mathematics & Statistics","","","","Springer","Singapore","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DUIVVFMV\Malumfashi et al. - 2021 - An EPQ Model for Delayed Deteriorating Items with .pdf","","excluded; not an application","EPQ; Linear holding cost; Quadratic demands; Two-phase; Variable demand rates","Mohd, Mohd Hafiz; Misro, Md Yushalify; Ahmad, Syakila; Nguyen Ngoc, Doanh","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

For solving the problem, we discuss the Multi-objective Evolutionary Swarm Hybridization (MESH) algorithm, a recently proposed multi-objective swarm intelligence-based optimization method which has obtained very competitive results when compared to existing evolutionary algorithms in specific applications. The MESH approach has been applied to find the optimal water discharge and the power produced at the maximum reservoir volume for all possible combinations of turbines in a hydro-power plant. The performance of MESH has been compared with that of well-known evolutionary approaches such as NSGA-II, NSGA-III, SPEA2, and MOEA/D in a realistic problem considering data from a hydro-power energy system with two cascaded hydro-power plants in Brazil.

When the exchange includes an extensive set of diverse stock, particular concepts and mechanisms for physical security, network security, encryption, and permissions should guarantee and predict its future needs. This study aimed to show it is efficient to use the group method of data handling (GMDH)-type neural networks and their application for the classification of numerical results. Such modeling serves to display the precision of GMDH-type neural networks. Following the US withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action in April 2018, the behavior of the stock exchange data stream and commend algorithms has not been able to predict correctly and fit in the network satisfactorily. This paper demonstrated that Group Method Data Handling is most likely to improve inductive self-organizing approaches for addressing realistic severe problems such as the Iranian financial market crisis. A new trajectory would be used to verify the consistency of the obtained equations hence the models' validity.","2021","2022-05-04 14:59:46","2022-05-13 22:48:48","","1-13","","1","4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://journal2.um.ac.id/index.php/keds/article/download/21183/8467</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, implementing fuzzy reasoning in inventory modelling is essential to manage uncertainties. This study has developed a model that deals with the production and replenishment co-ordination in a three-echelon supply chain involving two manufacturers and a retailer with fuzzy parameters formulated as triangular fuzzy numbers. The model is thus designed in a way that verifies the unreliable nature of the production process and segregates the defective products from the perfect products. The defective products are routed to another market where they can be sold at a reduced price while the perfect products reach the manufacturer and in turn, the retailer. In today’s scenario, it has become vital to incorporate green activities into supply chain management. Here the study provided an end of life treatment of the retired products and the reverse flow of products has been considered as the responsibility of the manufacturer. The model considers the costs of idle times at the end of both manufacturers. It is a general model that can be a useful equipment for any kind of product but to show its practicability, we have introduced the example of the tennis racket. It is demonstrated by the numerical examples that the collection of the buyback products is lucrative for the system and the vagueness in the demand parameter affects the most to the optimality instead of other parameters.

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the ﬁtness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these ﬁndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the ﬁtness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The ﬁrst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the ﬁtness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the ﬁtness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm is compared with some state-ofthe-art algorithms from PATAT competition conferences and experimental results are presented.","2021-04","2022-05-04 14:30:07","2022-05-13 22:40:10","2022-05-04 14:30:07","114211","","","168","","Expert Systems with Applications","How to exploit fitness landscape properties of timetabling problem","","","","","","","en","","","","","DOI.org (Crossref)","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AKDUX97Q\Najaran - 2021 - How to exploit fitness landscape properties of tim.pdf","","included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

With our method, the constraints and objective functions in the target optimization problems are represented as fundamental characteristics of Petri net models, extracted systematically from Petri net models, and then converted into binary quadratic nets, equivalent to Ising models.

Meanwhile, it is increasingly important that the knowledge of quantum technologies is accessible to those who work with real-world applications and is taught to the younger generation.Purpose: Resulting from collaborative dialogue between physicists, computer scientists, educationalists, and industrial end users, we propose the concept of quantum literacy as one means of addressing the need for transdisciplinary research in response to the complex problems that we see at the heart of issues around global sustainability. In this way, quantum literacy can contribute to UN Sustainable Development Goal 4, Quality Education.Methods: We introduce a specific puzzle visualization learning tool through which to achieve the pedagogic ends we set out with respect to quantum literacy. Visualization through puzzles can enable non-specialists to develop an intuitive, but still rigorous, understanding of universal quantum computation and provide a facility for non-specialists to discover increasingly complex and new quantum algorithms. Using the Hong–Ou–Mandel optical effect from quantum mechanics, we demonstrate how visual methods such as those made possible through the puzzle visualization tool can be very useful for understanding underlying complex processes in quantum physics and beyond and therefore support the aims of quantum literacy.Conclusion: We argue that quantum literacy, as defined here, addresses the challenges of learning within a highly bounded discipline and of access to the kind of powerful knowledge that should be more accessible to a wide group of learners. We therefore argue for the importance of addressing pedagogic issues when powerful knowledge consists of dense concepts, as well as complex and hierarchical relations between concepts, in addition to presenting a strong barrier to entry in the form of mathematics.","2021-05-05","2022-05-04 11:57:34","2022-05-13 22:39:09","2022-05-04 11:57:34","1-17","","0","0","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Taylor and Francis+NEJM","","Publisher: Routledge _eprint: https://doi.org/10.1080/02635143.2021.1920905","<p>https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02635143.2021.1920905?needAccess=true</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\WJWBZRX9\Nita et al. - 2021 - The challenge and opportunities of quantum literac.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","quantum computation; games; mathematics; powerful knowledge; Quantum literacy","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, some of these spectral bands are redundant and/or noisy, and hence, selecting highly informative and trustworthy bands for each class is a vital step for classification and for saving internal storage space; then the selected bands are termed a highly informative spectral band subset. We use a mutual information (MI)-based method to select the spectral band subset of a given class and two additional binary quantum classifiers, namely a quantum boost (Qboost) and a quantum boost plus (Qboost-Plus) classifier, to classify a two-label dataset characterized by the selected band subset. We pose both our MI-based band subset selection problem and the binary quantum classifiers as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem. Such a quadratic problem is solvable with the help of conventional optimization techniques. However, the QUBO problem is an NP-hard global optimization problem, and hence, it is worthwhile for applying a quantum annealer. Thus, we adapted our MI-based optimization problem for selecting highly informative bands for each class of a given HSI to be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer. After the selection of these highly informative bands for each class, we employ our binary quantum classifiers to a two-label dataset on the D-Wave quantum annealer. In addition, we provide a novel multilabel classifier exploiting an error-encoding output code when using our binary quantum classifiers. As a real-world dataset in Earth observation, we used the well-known AVIRIS HSI of Indian Pine, north-western Indiana, USA. We can demonstrate that the MI-based band subset selection problem can be run on a D-Wave quantum annealer that selects the highly informative spectral band subset for each target class in the Indian Pine HSI. We can also prove that our binary quantum classifiers and our novel multilabel classifier generate a correct two- and multilabel dataset characterized by their selected bands and with high accuracy such as having been produced by conventional classifiers-and even better in some instances.","2021","2022-05-04 10:23:54","2022-05-13 22:38:13","","7057-7065","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Applied Earth Observations and Remote Sensing","<p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/4609443/4609444/09477115.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\S8J99UQG\9477115.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DCKRXHE9\Otgonbaatar and Datcu - 2021 - A Quantum Annealer for Subset Feature Selection an.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Feature extraction; Annealing; Quantum mechanics; Sensors; D-wave quantum annealer (QA); Earth; feature selection; hyperspectral images (HSIs); Hyperspectral imaging; mutual information (MI); quantum classifier; quantum machine learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A QUBO problem belongs to the family of Integer Programming problems which are called the NP-hard optimization problems. Feasible solutions of such problems can be found by using classical optimization techniques. However, studies claim that QA can find a feasible global solution that is faster than a classical annealer for QUBO problems. Hence, it appears promising to program and use the QA-to-QUBO approach for Earth Observation. In search of the QUBO problem in the domain of Earth Observation, we examined several Inteferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) applications and identified a residue connection problem in the phase unwrapping procedure. In particular, we consider the residue connection problem with multiples of 2pi as a QUBO problem. For this practical problem, we studied how to formulate this QUBO problem, and we examined the challenges to program the D-Wave quantum annealer, in particular, embedding the QUBO problem into our QA architecture with a so-called Pegasus topology, and the annealing parameter settings in the D-Wave quantum annealer. We then analysed the parameter effects on finding the global minimum of the residue connection problem. From these results, we derived and enhanced our insight for programming future quantum annealers; for instance, choosing real-world problems in Earth Observation, conceiving the embedding procedure, and the tuning of the annealing parameters.","2021-03","2022-05-04 11:16:15","2022-05-13 22:38:09","","1-4","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\FEQIWSRK\9472581.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AHLFFRAT\Otgonbaatar and Datcu - 2021 - Quantum annealer for network flow minimization in .pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","EUSAR 2021; 13th European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Aiming at the characteristics of AUVs that are easily interfered by ocean currents when working in actual environments, this paper focuses on the task allocation and path planning of multi-AUV based on the QPSO (Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization) under constant ocean current environment kinematics constraints, and solution results of the standard particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm and the quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm are compared. The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal. Finally, in order to achieve the purpose of detecting the effectiveness of the algorithm, the simulation results are given in this paper.","2021-10","2022-05-11 16:20:19","2022-05-13 22:31:52","","4844-4849","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2688-0938","<p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\W8SMRTCV\9727785.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2Y6MPEQI\Pang et al. - 2021 - Task allocation for multi-AUV system under ocean c.pdf","","included","Wave functions; Task analysis; Resource management; Simulation; Energy consumption; Kinematics constrains; Multi-autonomous underwater vehicle systems; Oceans; Path planning; Quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO); Task allocation","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2021 China Automation Congress (CAC)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we perform a case study on how to augment existing software with quantum computational primitives for the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) implemented using a quantum annealer (QA). We discuss relevant quality measures for quantum components, and show that mathematically equivalent, but structurally different ways of transforming SAT to a QA can lead to substantial differences regarding these qualities.

This algorithm is employed to calculate different units generation in a generating plant , so that the total fuel cost can be minimized , as well as to meet the total demand and losses.

It eliminates false positives by only keeping the image $$\mathcal {M}$$Mwith highest detection score and images whose overlap ratio with $$\mathcal {M}$$Mis less than a predefined threshold. However, this greedy algorithm may not work well for object detection under occlusion scenario where true positives with lower detection scores are possibly suppressed. In this paper, we first map the task of removing redundant detections into Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) framework that consists of detection score from each bounding box and overlap ratio between pair of bounding boxes. Next, we solve the QUBO problem using the proposed Quantum-soft QUBO Suppression (QSQS) algorithm for fast and accurate detection by exploiting quantum computing advantages. Experiments indicate that QSQS improves mean average precision from 74.20% to 75.11% for PASCAL VOC 2007.

The model was developed by first defining the total profit of the supply chain members under carbon tax regulation and, second, considering a manufacturer (leader)–retailer (follower) Stackelberg game. The optimal equilibrium solutions that maximize the manufacturer’s and retailer’s total profits were determined through the method analysis. An algorithm complemented the model to determine the optimal equilibrium solutions, which were then treated with sensitivity analyses for the major parameters. Based on the numerical analysis, (a) carbon tax policies help reduce carbon emissions for both the manufacturer and retailer; (b) most carbon emissions from supply chain operations negatively impact the total profits of both members; (c) the retailer may increase the optimal equilibrium selling price to respond to an increase in carbon emissions from supply chain operations or carbon tax; and (d) autonomous consumption positively affects both members’ optimal equilibrium policies and total profits, whereas induced consumption does the opposite. These findings are very managerial and instructive for companies seeking profits and fulfilling environmental responsibility and governments.","2020-01","2022-05-04 11:22:59","2022-05-15 20:14:00","2022-05-04 11:22:59","4878","","14","10","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 14 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UBK8RYFR\Lu et al. - 2020 - A Multistage Sustainable Production–Inventory Mode.pdf","","excluded; not an application","carbon emission; multistage supply chain; price-dependent demand; production–inventory model; Stackelberg game","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The aim of this paper is to investigate the characteristics and application features of an integrated compound energy storage system via simulation and a small-scale hardware system implementation. This paper first discusses the main components, working principles and operating modes of the proposed compound energy storage system. Then, a detailed design example composed of supercapacitors, batteries, and various controllers used in two typical application scenarios, peak demand shaving and power generation smoothing, of a grid-connected microgrid is systematically presented. Finally, an experimental setup with proper power converters and control schemes are implemented for the verification of the proposed control scheme.

If the virtual machine is placed nearer to the Internet of Things nodes, it increases their efficiency by manifold. Virtual machine placement optimization is a trial and error method. Many new algorithms will be proposed and their results are tested against the desired metrics, and the successful ones are continuously modified to get better results. Placement of the virtual machines is the main goal. Resources should be available based on the need and cannot be allocated statistically based on the peak workload elasticity of cloud traffic engineering. In this area, nature-inspired algorithms are preferred as they are capable of finding a better candidate solution in a vast problem search space. A few notable nature-inspired algorithms are flower pollination algorithm, particle swarm optimization algorithm, ant colony algorithm, ant bee colony algorithm, and firefly algorithm. Out of all these algorithms, particle swarm optimization and ant colony algorithms are the ones that attracted many researchers.

In the previous decade, the access of renewable energy opening for energy production has improved significantly. WE has become an important source that has begun to be used for energy all over the world in recent years. The optimal dispatch between thermal and wind units to minimize the total generating costs and emission are considered as multi-objective (MO) model. In MO optimization, whole electrical energy generation costs and burning emissions are concurrently minimized. The performance of aforesaid approach is exercised and it proves itself as a superior technique as compared to other algorithms revealed in the literature.","2020","2022-05-04 12:26:01","2022-05-15 20:12:49","","160-194","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.4018/978-1-7998-3222-5.ch009","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Apart from functionality, systems also have to satisfy extra-functional requirements that may include behavioural constraints that the software must adhere to, as well as qualities to optimise such as performance, availability, and energy efficiency. These qualities are often inter-dependent and heavily influenced by the structure of the system. This results in poorly understood multi-dimensional design spaces, in which trade-offs among qualities are not evident when making architectural decisions. This paper presents Voyager, a tool which allows engineers to visualise architectural configurations and explore the trade-offs among their quality attributes in a multi-dimensional design space. The tool produces contextual visualisations to facilitate trade-off analysis, providing engineers with a streamlined way of understanding architectural design spaces, using an approach that combines architectural structure with multi-dimensional data visualisations. A user study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the tool. Results show that participants achieved a significantly higher accuracy in a shorter time span and had a better user experience when using Voyager, with respect to an existing comparable tool.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:44","2022-05-15 20:12:31","","55-67","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-59155-7_5","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, in the case of small training data, transfer-learning is rather preferable. This is a complex process for high dimensional feature space due to the curse of dimensionality. To mitigate the same, this paper proposes a new feature selection method for the classification of manually created fake-face images. In the proposed method, a pre-trained deep learning model is used to extract features of an image. Next, an optimal feature subset is selected from the extracted features through an improved quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm. Lastly, the elicited features are considered to perform the classification. Experiments are conducted on a publicly available manually created fake-face image dataset, namely Real and Fake Face Detection by Yonsei University. The performance of the proposed method is compared with two methods in terms of classification accuracy and the number of selected features. The experimental comparisons exhibit that the proposed method achieves promising results among the considered methods.","2020","2022-05-11 14:32:39","2022-05-15 20:12:03","","989-995","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\BXCZLL5U\Mittal et al. - 2020 - Fake-Face Image Classification using Improved Quan.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Feature extraction; Clustering algorithms; Quantum computing; Deep learning; Evolutionary computation; Deep Learning; Software; Feature Selection; Fake-Face Image Classification; Manuals; Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"IC57LPGN","journalArticle","2020","Mugemanyi, Sylvere; Qu, Zhaoyang; Rugema, François Xavier; Dong, Yunchang; Bananeza, Christophe; Wang, Lei","Optimal Reactive Power Dispatch Using Chaotic Bat Algorithm","IEEE Access","","2169-3536","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2982988","","In this paper, the chaotic bat algorithm (CBA) is applied to solve the optimal reactive power dispatch (ORPD) problem taking into account small-scale, medium-scale and large-scale power systems. ORPD plays a key role in the power system operation and control. The ORPD problem is formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem, comprising both continuous and discrete control variables. The most outstanding benefit of the bat algorithm (BA) is its good convergence for optimal solutions. The BA, however, together with other metaheuristics, often gets stuck into local optima and in order to cope with this shortcoming, the use of the CBA is proposed in this paper. The CBA results from introducing the chaotic sequences into the standard BA to enhance its global search ability. The CBA is utilized to find the optimal settings of generator bus voltages, tap setting transformers and shunt reactive power sources. Three objective functions such as minimization of active power loss, total voltage deviations and voltage stability index are considered in this study. The effectiveness of the CBA technique is demonstrated for standard IEEE 14-bus, IEEE 39 New England bus, IEEE 57-bus, IEEE 118-bus and IEEE 300-bus test systems. The results yielded by the CBA are compared with other algorithms available in the literature.

This system suffers from unavoidable power losses and consequently voltage profile deviation which affects the overall efficiency of the system; hence the need to reduce these losses and voltage magnitude deviations. The existing methods of incorporation of static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) controllers to solve these problems suffer from incorrect location and sizing, which could bring about insignificant reduction in transmission network losses and voltage magnitude deviations. Hence, this research aims to reduce transmission network losses and voltage magnitude deviation in transmission network by suitable allocation of STATCOM controller using firefly algorithm (FA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO). A mathematical steady-state STATCOM power injection model was formulated from one voltage source representation to generate new set of equations, which was incorporated into the Newton-Raphson (NR) load flow solution algorithm and then optimized using PSO and FA. The approach was applied to IEEE 14-bus network and simulations were performed using MATLAB program. The results showed that the best STATCOM controller locations in the system after optimization were at bus 11 and 9 with the injection of shunt reactive power of 8.96 MVAr, and 9.54 MVAr with PSO and FA, respectively. The total active power loss for the network under consideration at steady state, with STATCOM only and STATCOM controller optimized using PSO and FA, were 6.251 MW, 6.075 MW, 5.819 MW and 5.581 MW, respectively. The corresponding reactive power were 14.256 MVAr, 13.857 MVAr, 12.954 MVAr and 12.156 MVAr, respectively. In addition, bus voltage profile improvement indicates the effectiveness of metaheuristic methods of STATCOM optimization. However, FA gave a better power loss and voltage magnitude deviations minimizations over PSO. The study concluded that FA is more effective as an optimization technique for suitably locating and sizing of STATCOM controller on a power transmission system.","2020","2022-05-03 17:15:44","2022-05-15 20:10:27","2022-05-03 17:15:44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","en","","Thesis","","","ukzn-dspace.ukzn.ac.za","","Accepted: 2021-01-27T11:21:04Z","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\D3CD3ZRR\Ogunwole - 2020 - Optimal placement of statcom controllers with meta.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\WZF6PLBB\19086.html","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is a big challenge to utilize hydro and thermal generating unit properly. Researchers are trying to explore new techniques to improve scheduling of generating units. Environmental matter is a big issue to modern society. This chapter suggests a well-organized and effective approach using concept of grey wolf optimization (GWO) to deal with non-linear, multi-objective, short-term, hydro-thermal scheduling (MOHTS) problem. Moreover, authors have incorporated oppositional based learning (OBL) to enhance characteristics of GWO to achieve solution more consistently and accurately. To explore authenticity of our proposed algorithms, GWO and OGWO (oppositional based GWO) are applied to multi-chain cascade of 4-hydro and 3-thermal test system. Effective constraints like valve-point loading, water discharge, water storage, etc., are considered here. Statistical comparisons with other enlisted heuristic methods are done.

Airports are service sectors and provide services to their customers. Passengers and airlines are two main customers of an airport. Current research presents a novel mathematical model for gate assignment problem to minimize customers’ dissatisfaction. In other words, passengers walking time as well as flight delays are minimized in as objective function. In this model, transit and non-transit passengers and also arrival and departure flights are considered. Moreover, operational safety constraints are inserted to avoid collision of large aircraft. The proposed model is solved by Benders decomposition approach. The model is applied in San Francisco International Airport for a 24-hour horizon. The result shows that walking time of non-transit passengers, walking time of transit passengers, delay in departure flights and delay in arrivals include 74.55, 23.32, 0.96 and 1.17 percent of the objective function, respectively.","2020-12-01","2022-05-04 12:02:55","2022-05-15 20:07:18","2022-05-04 12:02:55","82-92","","4","16","","","A new mathematical model for gate assignment problem considering transit passengers and safety constraints","","","","","","","","","","","","jiei.azad.ac.ir","","Publisher: Islamic Azad University, South Tehran Branch","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ZAVQGRZH\Rashidi Komijan and Nasrollahpourniazi - 2020 - A new mathematical model for gate assignment probl.pdf","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The cost of exchangers is considered a prime constraint for users. Researchers and scientists are working in different platforms to minimize the cost of heat exchanger. Many optimization methods have evolved to minimize the cost parameters. In the last decades, bio-inspired optimizations have become widely used by researchers as a reliable technique. In this chapter, some excellent researches are discussed emphasizing economic cost optimization for STHX using bio-inspired algorithms. The focus of the chapter is to find efficient algorithms for energy conservation and comparative analysis to highlight their efficacy. The analysis for case 1, case 2, and case 3 shows that the total cost of STHX can be reduced in the range of 14%–35% (EM, QPSOZ, Elitist-Jaya), 24%–37% (GSA, EM, Elitist-Jaya), and 52%–56% (BBO, EM, PSO) respectively.","2020","2022-05-04 12:42:28","2022-05-15 20:05:08","","413-429","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-12-819422-5.00019-0","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It computes the values of the objective function $E(X)$ for all n-bit input vector X in $O(2^n)$ time. Since $Ømega(2^n)$ time is necessary to output $E(X)$ for all 2n vectors X, this sequential algorithm is optimal. We also present a work-time optimal parallel algorithm running $O(\log n)$ time using $2^n/\log n$ processors on the CREW-PRAM. This parallel algorithm is work optimal, because the total number of computational operations is equal to the running time of the optimal sequential algorithm. Also, it is time optimal because any parallel algorithm using any large number of processors takes at least $Ømega(\log n)$ time for evaluating E(X). Further, we have implemented this parallel algorithm to run on the GPU. The experimental results on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 2080Ti GPU show that our GPU implementation runs more than 1000 times faster than the sequential algorithm running on Intel Corei7-8700K CPU(3.70GHz) for the QUBO with n-bit vector whenever n$\geq$33. We also compare our exhaustive search parallel algorithm with several non-exhaustive search approaches for solving the QUBO including D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, simulated annealing algorithm, and Gurobi optimizer.","2020","2022-05-11 16:36:21","2022-05-15 20:00:34","","557-566","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Nevertheless, the lack of resources and qualified manpower usually constitutes a big obstacle to its adequate application, generally translating into sub-optimal generation systems with poor levels of efficiency. Therefore, the study and development of expert, simple and efficient strategies to assist the design of these installations is of especial relevance. This work proposes a design methodology based on a tailored messy evolutionary computational approach, with the objective of finding the most suitable layout of MHPP, considering several constraints derived from a minimal power supply requirement, the maximum flow usage, and the physical feasibility of the plant in accordance with the real terrain profile. This profile is built on the basis of a discrete topographic survey, by means of a shape-preserving interpolation, which permits the application of a continuous variable-length Messy Genetic Algorithm (MGA). The optimization problem is then formulated in both single-objective (cost minimization) and multi-objective (cost minimization and power supply maximization) modes, including the study of the Pareto dominance. The algorithm is applied to a real scenario in a remote community in Honduras, obtaining a 56.96% of cost reduction with respect to previous works.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:42","2022-05-15 20:00:28","","113539","","","159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The economic operation of the power system is always desirable and this can be achieved by economic load dispatch. The economic load dispatch means allocating the power to different generating units to minimize or reduce the total fuel cost satisfying the different power system constraints. The main purpose of economic load dispatch (ELD) is to allocate the total power at generating units to meet total load demand with minimum operational cost fulfilling all operational obstacles (constraints). For optimal dispatch of power, different evolutionary optimization techniques are being used like CSO, PSO, etc. In this paper, PSO has been implemented on MATLAB to minimize the total cost for 3-unit and 6-unit systems and the results are compared with CSO and other evolutionary optimization techniques for different power demands.","2020","2022-05-11 14:23:08","2022-05-15 20:00:19","","51-64","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-981-15-2329-8_6","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ATCOs are in an urgent need of assistant tools to aid them in dealing with increased traffic, specifically in resolving potential conflict. Because current automated conflict resolutions are not in conformance with the thinking or preferences of individual ATCOs, consequently, they are unlikely accepted by the ATCOs. In this work, an artificial intelligence (AI) system is built as a digital assistant to support ATCOs in resolving potential conflicts. Our system consists of two core components: an intelligent interactive conflict solver (iCS) to acquire ATCOs’ demonstrations, and an AI agent. The AI agent is based on reinforcement learning to suggest conflict resolutions. It is observed that providing the AI agent with the human resolutions, which are acquired and characterized by our intelligent interactive conflicts solver, not only improves the agent’s performance but also gives it the capability to suggest more humanlike resolutions. That could help to increase the ATCOs’ acceptance rate of the agent’s suggested resolutions. Our system could be further developed as personalized digital assistants of ATCOs to maintain their workloads manageable when they have to deal with sectors with increased traffic.","2020-06","2022-05-04 10:32:20","2022-05-15 20:00:12","2022-05-04 10:32:20","271-277","","6","17","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arc.aiaa.org (Atypon)","","Publisher: American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics","<p>https://dr.ntu.edu.sg/bitstream/10356/144383/2/JAIS_Manuscript_Resubmitted__R1%20%282%29.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","Artificial Intelligence; Neural Networks; Air Traffic Controller; Air Traffic Management System; Air Transportation; Airspace; Closest Point of Approach; Graphical User Interface; Inverse Reinforcement Learning; Mathematical Models","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Due to the complexity of optimization, many timetabling problems are done manually by one of an experienced person. In this paper, solving the timetabling problem for universities has been discussed. Genetic algorithms have been used for the solution. Both hard and soft constraints have been taken into account. Hard constraints are ensured for conflicts while soft constraints are satisfied lecturers, classes, classrooms.

On the other hand, users know certain characteristics of solutions they are interested in. Such characteristics are typically measured with Quality Indicators (QIs) that are commonly used to evaluate the quality of solutions produced by an MOSA. Consequently, these QIs are often employed to empirically evaluate a set of MOSAs for a particular search problem to find the best MOSA. Thus, to guide SBSE users in choosing an MOSA that represents the solutions measured by a specific QI they are interested in, we present an empirical evaluation with a set of SBSE problems to study the relationships among commonly used QIs and MOSAs in SBSE. Our aim, by studying such relationships, is to identify whether there are certain characteristics of a QI because of which it prefers a certain MOSA. Such preferences are then used to provide insights and suggestions to SBSE users in selecting an MOSA, given that they know which quality aspects of solutions they are looking for.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:44","2022-05-16 14:54:47","","25-41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-59762-7_3","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

At each iteration of RQA, after analyzing results (samples) from the previous iteration, the agent adjusts the penalty of unsatisfied constraints and re-casts the given problem to a new Ising Hamiltonian. As a proof-of-concept, we propose a novel approach for casting the problem of Boolean satisfiability (SAT) to Ising Hamiltonians and show how to apply the RQA for increasing the probability of finding the global optimum. Our experimental results on two different benchmark SAT problems (namely factoring pseudo-prime numbers and random SAT with phase transitions), using a D-Wave 2000Q quantum processor, demonstrated that RQA finds notably better solutions with fewer samples, compared to the best-known techniques in the realm of quantum annealing.","2020","2022-05-11 16:36:20","2022-05-16 14:54:11","","7952","","1","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-64078-1.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To conduct quantum key distribution (QKD) in a finite time interval, there is a need to estimate photon states and analyze the fluctuations statistically. The use of brute force and local search methods for parameter optimization are computationally intensive and becomes an infeasible solution even for smaller connections. Therefore, the use of quantum machine learning models with self-learning ability is useful in predicting the optimal parameters for quantum key distribution.

These circuits must be made with low losses so that the quantum information is retained for as long as possible. We developed fabrication processes achieving state-of-the-art coherence times of over 100 µs. We identified the primary source of loss to be parasitic two-level systems by studying fluctuations of qubit relaxation times. Using our high-coherence circuits, we implemented a quantum processor built on fixed-frequency qubits and frequency-tunable couplers. The tunable couplers were lumped-element LC resonators, where the inductance came from a superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID). We achieved a controlled-phase gate with a fidelity of 99% by parametric modulation of the coupler frequency. Using this device, and another similar to it, we demonstrated two different quantum algorithms, the quantum approximate optimization algorithm, and density matrix exponentiation. We achieved high algorithmic fidelities, aided by our carefully calibrated gates. Additionally, we researched parametric oscillations using frequency-tunable resonators. Previously, degenerate parametric oscillations have been demonstrated by modulation of the resonant frequency at twice that frequency. We use this phenomenon to implement a readout method for a superconducting qubit with a fidelity of 98.7%. We demonstrated correlated radiation in nondegenerate parametric oscillations by modulating at the sum of two resonant frequencies of a multimode resonator. We showed an excellent quantitative agreement between the classical properties of the oscillations with a theoretical model. Moreover, we studied higher-order modulation at up to five times their resonant frequencies. These types of parametric oscillation states might be used as a quantum resource for continuous-variable quantum computing.","2020","2022-05-04 12:01:13","2022-05-16 14:52:45","2022-05-04 12:01:13","","147","","","","","","","","","","","Ann Arbor, United States","Inglês","Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.","Ph.D.","","","ProQuest","","ISBN: 9798496569712","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\F4XVW3AT\Bengtsson - 2020 - Quantum Information Processing with Tunable and Lo.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Optimization; Computer science; Computers; Quantum computing; Power; Energy; Engineering; Sensors; Algorithms; Quantum physics; Mathematics; Information processing; Atomic physics; Atoms & subatomic particles; Circuits; Computational physics; Electrical engineering; Electromagnetism; Linear algebra; Particle accelerators; Physics; Quantum dots; Radiation; Random access memory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this work, we address such problems with emerging quantum computing technology and propose several reformulations of QAPs as unconstrained problems suitable for efficient execution on quantum hardware. We investigate several ways to inject permutation matrix constraints in a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem which can be mapped to quantum hardware. We focus on obtaining a sufficient spectral gap, which further increases the probability to measure optimal solutions and valid permutation matrices in a single run. We perform our experiments on the quantum computer D-Wave 2000Q(211 qubits, adiabatic). Despite the observed discrepancy between simulated adiabatic quantum computing and execution on real quantum hardware, our reformulation of permutation matrix constraints increases the robustness of the numerical computations over other penalty approaches in our experiments. The proposed algorithm has the potential to scale to higher dimensions on future quantum computing architectures, which opens up multiple new directions for solving matching problems in 3D computer vision and graphics.","2020-11","2022-05-04 11:57:43","2022-05-16 14:52:08","","583-592","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","ISSN: 2475-7888","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04032</p>; <p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.04032</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\WDZRNBA5\Seelbach Benkner et al. - 2021 - Adiabatic Quantum Graph Matching with Permutation .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\XGU7AE4K\9320310.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\BTVPNEMP\Benkner et al. - 2020 - Adiabatic Quantum Graph Matching with Permutation .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Annealing; Three-dimensional displays; Hardware; Qubit; Adiabatic; Computer vision; Shape; Computer Science; Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition; cs.CV","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze non-planar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, a theoretical, or otherwise limiting. This paper reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open‐source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools. The paper concludes with paths forward, emphasizing open-source software and reusable computational data science beyond mere reproducibility and replicability.","2020","2022-05-11 15:39:34","2022-05-16 14:50:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://escholarship.org/content/qt6zt4x7j8/qt6zt4x7j8.pdf?t=qguyds</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Our recent search-based testing approach offers a solution to this problem by defining a collision as avoidable if a differently configured ADS would have avoided it. This approach searches for both collision scenarios and the ADS configurations capable of avoiding them. However, its main problem is that the ADS configurations generated for avoiding some collisions are not suitable for preventing other ones. Therefore, it does not provide any guidance to automotive engineers for improving the safety of the ADS. To this end, we propose a new search-based approach to generate configurations of the ADS that can avoid as many different types of collisions as possible. We present two versions of the approach, which differ in the way of searching for collisions and alternative configurations. The approaches have been experimented on the path planner component of an ADS provided by our industry partner.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:43","2022-05-16 14:49:19","","1055-1063","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A novel multi-agent cooperative reduced-dimension Q(λ) (MCR-Q(λ)) is proposed for solving the model. Firstly, on the basis of the traditional single-objective Q(λ) algorithm, the solution space is reduced effectively to shrink the size of Q-value matrices. Then, based on the concept of ant cooperative cooperation, multi-agents are used to update the Q-value matrices iteratively, which can significantly improve the updating rate. The simulation in the IEEE 118-bus system indicates that the proposed technique can decrease the convergence speed by hundreds of times as compared with conventional Q(λ), keeping high global stability, which is very suitable for dynamic OCECF in a large and complex power grid compared with other algorithms.","2020","2022-05-03 16:13:10","2022-05-16 14:49:12","","4778","","18","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/13/18/4778/pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\UJQYEIE2\Cao et al. - 2020 - Multi-Agent Cooperation Based Reduced-Dimension Q(.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\2ICR4AS3\4778.html","","excluded; not an application","multi-agent cooperation; optimal carbon-energy combined-flow; reduced-dimension Q(λ)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This methodology consists of a standardized set of questions which should be asked to determine how and indeed if, near term quantum computing can play a role in a given application. Developing such a set of questions is important because it allows different use cases to be evaluated in a fair and objective way, rather than considering each case on an ad hoc basis which could lead to an evaluation which focuses on positives of a use case, while ignoring weaknesses. To demonstrate our methodology we apply it to a concrete use case, ambulance dispatch, and find that there are some ways in which near term quantum computing could be deployed sensibly, but also demonstrate some cases ways in which its use would not be advised. The purpose of this paper is to initiate a dialogue within the community of quantum computing scientists and potential end users on what questions should be asked when developing real world use cases.","2020-06-10","2022-05-04 11:06:38","2022-05-16 14:49:01","2022-05-04 11:06:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","arXiv.org","","arXiv: 2006.05846","Comment: 9 pages, 3 figures","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4NH47GM8\Chancellor et al. - 2020 - Toward a standardized methodology for constructing.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\EKY7SUYP\2006.html","","excluded; not a primary study","Computer Science - Artificial Intelligence; Quantum Physics","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.","2020","2022-05-11 15:39:30","2022-05-16 14:41:20","","531-545","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41","<p>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-030-50433-5_41.pdf</p>","","","included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The Symposium on Search Based Software Engineering (SSBSE) is the premier event on SBSE, which had its 11 th edition in 2019. Objective In order to better understand the characteristics and evolution of papers published at SSBSE, this work reports results from a mapping study targeting the proceedings of all SSBSE editions. Despite the existing mapping studies on SBSE, our contribution in this work is to provide information to researchers and practitioners willing to enter the SBSE field, being a source of information to strengthen the symposium, guide new studies, and motivate new collaboration among research groups. Method A systematic mapping study was conducted with a set of four research questions, in which 134 studies published in all editions of SSBSE, dated from 2009 to 2019, were evaluated. In a fifth question, 32 papers published in the challenge track were summarised. Results Throughout the years, 290 authors from 25 countries have contributed to the main track of the symposium, with the collaboration of at least two institutions in 46.3% of the papers. SSBSE papers have got substantial external visibility, as most citations are from different venues. The SE tasks addressed by SSBSE are mostly related to software testing, software debugging, software design, and maintenance. Evolutionary algorithms are present in 75% of the papers, being the most common search technique. The evaluation of the SBSE approaches usually includes industrial systems. Conclusions SSBSE has helped increase the popularity of SBSE in the SE research community and has played an important role on making SBSE mature. There are still problems and challenges to be addressed in the SBSE field, which can be tackled by SSBSE authors in further studies.","2020","2022-05-04 12:38:43","2022-05-16 14:40:42","","106372","","","127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10104012/1/SSBSE_2019ExtensionIST__Revision1.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It includes rework process, screening of imperfect items and partial backlogging. The items are partially serviceable, because at the time of production some items are found to be defective which cannot be recoverable or serviceable. At first, we develop a cost minimization problem under several assumptions related to imperfect items and rework process under certain linear constraints. We solve the crisp model (primal nonlinear problem) first, and then we convert this model into equivalent game problem taking the help of the theories related to strong and weak duality theorem. However, this game problem consists of the Lagrangian function that correspond a nonlinear objective function subject to some linear constraints. The main objective of the study is to develop a solution procedure of the problem associated to an imperfect process where all unit cost components might increase or decrease neutrosophically. Thus, according to the experiences gained by the decision maker (DM) we fuzzify all cost components as sub-neutrosophic offset. To defuzzify the model we have utilized the sine cuts of neutrosophic fuzzy numbers followed by a solution procedure developed in solving the matrix game exclusively. To validate the model, a numerical example is studied then we have compared the optimal results among the original problem, the equivalent game problem and the game problem under neutrosophic environment explicitly. Our findings reveal that under negative α-cuts the value of the objective function assumes lower and higher values. Finally, sensitivity analysis, graphical illustrations, conclusions and scope of future works have been discussed.","2020-08-01","2022-05-04 11:22:19","2022-05-16 14:40:15","2022-05-04 11:22:19","106397","","","93","","Applied Soft Computing","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\4RUZSFGB\De et al. - 2020 - Solution of an EPQ model for imperfect production .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DEW4K295\S1568494620303379.html","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Game theory; Deterioration; Backlogging; EPQ model; Imperfect items; Neutrosophic offset; Rework; Sine-cut","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is essentially a Multi-objective Optimization Problem, which minimizes both fuel cost and emission pollution simultaneously, as well as meets some system limits. This study transforms EED problem to a single-objective problem with weighted sum method, and then use Newton method to solve the equality constraint iteratively and introduce a common penalty function to deal with the inequality constraint. Moreover, this study tries to propose a new meta-heuristic algorithm inspired by kernel tricks to solve EED problem with no hyper parameters to be tuned. The new algorithm can map a non-linear objective function into a linear one with higher-dimension. Thus the optimization process could be transformed into a linear process, which is more likely to get the optimum solution. When applied in the 3 real-world EED cases with valve point, the new algorithm achieved a better performance compared with other algorithms in the literature.","2020","2022-05-11 16:29:20","2022-05-16 14:39:20","","16584-16594","","","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","Conference Name: IEEE Access","<p>Cited By :17</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8948470/08955854.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\FW2C3DJC\Dong and Wang - 2020 - New Optimization Algorithm Inspired by Kernel Tric.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Economics; Valves; Generators; Kernel; Fuels; Linear programming; Economic emission dispatch; Kernel search optimization; meta-heuristic algorithm; swarm intelligence","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In addition, we also employ the constraint handling method for salp swarm algorithm (SSA) and particle swarm optimization algorithm (PSO) to form modified SSA (MSSA) and modified PSO (MPSO). The three methods have been tested on 3-unit system and 10-unit system under the consideration of payment model for power reserve allocated, and constraints of system and generators. Result comparisons among MCSA and CSA indicate that the proposed constraint handling method is very useful for metaheuristic algorithms when solving OLDCEM problem. As compared to MSSA, MPSO as well as other previous methods, MCSA is more effective by finding higher total benefit for the two systems with faster manner and lower oscillations. Consequently, MCSA method is a very effective technique for OLDCEM problem in power systems.","2020-08-01","2022-05-11 16:32:03","2022-05-16 14:39:03","2022-05-11 16:32:03","1542-1549","","4","9","","","","","","","","","","en","Copyright (c)","","","","beei.org","","Number: 4","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\7J53NHYU\Duong et al. - 2020 - Application of a new constraint handling method fo.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Economic load dispatch; Constraint handling method; Cuckoo search algorithm; Fitness function; Maximum profit","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Building physical systems with collective computational ability and distributed parallel processing capability can accelerate the ground-state search. Here, we present a continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) approach where the ground-state solution appears as stable points or attractor states of the CTDS. We harness the emergent dynamics of a network of phase-transition nano-oscillators (PTNO) to build an Ising Hamiltonian solver. The hardware fabric comprises of electrically coupled injection-locked stochastic PTNOs with bi-stable phases emulating artificial Ising spins. We demonstrate the ability of the stochastic PTNO-CTDS to progressively find more optimal solution by increasing the strength of the injection-locking signal – akin to performing classical annealing. We demonstrate in silico that the PTNO-CTDS prototype solves a benchmark non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard Max-Cut problem with high probability of success. Using experimentally calibrated numerical simulations, we investigate the performance of the hardware with increasing problem size. We show the best-in-class energy-efficiency of 3.26x107 solutions/sec/Watt which translates to over five orders of magnitude improvement when compared with digital CMOS, superconducting qubit and photonic Ising solver approaches. We also demonstrate an order of magnitude improvement over a discrete-time memristor-based Hopfield network approach. Such an energy efficient CTDS hardware exhibiting high solution-throughput/Watt can find application in industrial planning and manufacturing, defense and cyber-security, bioinformatics and drug discovery.","2020","2022-05-11 15:39:36","2022-05-16 14:38:59","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-93438/v1.pdf?c=1604516610000</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This method has been evaluated using different criteria and definitions. In the current study, the weight optimization problem is defined using PBD to consider more constraints than have been considered in other studies in this field. The problem has been formulated for eccentrically braced frame (EBF) structures. Thus far, weight optimization of EBFs using PBD has not been attempted. For this reason, the main objective has been to examine the possibility of optimizing the EBF weight based on PBD. A new method for modeling of the link beam has been used to evaluate its behavior. Structural analysis has been done using nonlinear static analysis (pushover). The performance of the proposed optimization process is demonstrated for the optimal design of two 2D EBF structures using four different metaheuristic algorithms.","2020-01-01","2022-05-05 18:23:34","2022-05-16 14:37:06","2022-05-05 18:23:34","109857","","","202","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :13</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ZAJZ7NLB\Fathali and Hoseini Vaez - 2020 - Optimum performance-based design of eccentrically .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Performance-based design; Metaheuristic algorithms; EBF system; Nonlinear static analysis; Weight optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

An effective strategy to deal with this scenario is to employ computational intelligence (CI) methods. CI supplements the heuristics used by the engineer—enhancing the cumulative analytic capacity to effectively resolve complicated scenarios. CI could be split to two classes: predictive modeling and optimization. In this chapter, past applications of CI in energy generation are discussed.

However, the Quantum Computing technology has not matured to a level where it can provide a clear advantage over high performance computing yet. Towards achieving this ""quantum advantage"", a larger number of Qubits is required, leading inevitably to a more complex topology of the computing Qubits. This raises additional difficulties with decoherence times and implies higher Qubit error rates. Nevertheless, the current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers can prove useful despite the intrinsic uncertainties on the quantum hardware layer. In order to utilize such error-prone computing resources, various concepts are required to address Qubit errors and to deliver successful computations. In this paper describe and motivate the need for the novel concept of Quantum DevOps. which entails regular checking of the reliability of NISQ Quantum Computing (QC) instances. By means of testing the computational reliability of basic quantum gates and computations (C-NOT, Hadamard, etc.)it consequently estimates the likelihood for a large scale critical computation (e.g. calculating hourly traffic flow models for a city) to provide results of sufficient quality. Following this approach to select the best matching (cloud) QC instance and having it integrated directly with the processes of development, testing and finally the operations of quantum based algorithms and systems enables the Quantum DevOps concept.","2020-12","2022-05-03 15:40:22","2022-05-16 14:34:21","","1-6","","","","","","Quantum DevOps","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\HTKBDMJ2\9367411.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\TE44GL8V\Gheorghe-Pop et al. - 2020 - Quantum DevOps Towards Reliable and Applicable NI.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Reliability; Topology; Computers; Uncertainty; Logic gates; Computational modeling; Quantum Computing; Qubit; Testing; DevOps; Framework; IT; Quantum DevOps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2020 IEEE Globecom Workshops (GC Wkshps","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed metaheuristic uses the Newton gradient-based method as its updating scheme in a population-based framework and therefore it is termed as Newton Metaheuristic Algorithm (NMA). In order to enable the NMA to effectively explore the discrete design space, a term containing the best solution found is added to the basic updating rule of the algorithm. In addition, a simple and efficient method is proposed in order to establish a balance between local and global search abilities of the proposed algorithm. The efficiency of the NMA is illustrated by presenting two benchmark discrete truss optimization problems. Moreover, three steel moment frames are optimized in the framework of performance-based design by the NMA and the results are compared with those of some recent metaheuristics.

As an important quantum computing approach, quantum annealing (QA) has received considerable attention. Extensive research has shown that QA, exploiting quantum-mechanical effects such as tunneling, entanglement and superposition, could be much more efficient in solving hard combinatorial optimization problems than its classical counterpart—simulated annealing. Recent advances in quantum annealing hardware open the possibility of empirical testing of QA against the most challenging computational problems arising in geospatial applications. This chapter demonstrates how to employ QA to solve NP-hard spatial optimization problems through an illustrative example of programming a p-median model and a case study on spatial supply chain optimization. The research findings also address the short- and long-term potential of quantum computing in the future development of high-performance computing for geospatial applications.","2020","2022-05-11 15:39:31","2022-05-16 14:33:35","","97-113","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-47998-5_6","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Tax incidence is the market output of both producers and consumers that respond to taxes with market equilibrium, whether the tax is levied on sellers or buyers. This paper aims to study the carbon tax incidence on the transmission level of a power system based on different carbon tax collection methods in electricity market environment. A statistical demand elasticity model, power flow and carbon emission flow models are applied to simulate the electricity market equilibrium to analyze the effects of the tax levied on demand‐side or supply‐side. Furthermore, the Australian 59‐bus system is employed in the case study with four stages and four main cases. The results demonstrate that consumers share more burden of the carbon tax in all carbon tax collection methods. Moreover, the proportion of the tax burden and emission reduction effect are different in each method and degree of renewable energy capacity. The results of this paper contribute to the establishment of emission‐related energy policies toward a low‐carbon economy.","2020","2022-05-04 14:37:36","2022-05-16 14:32:14","","34-44","","1","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1049/enc2.12005</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We proposed a simulation methodology in order to evaluate supercapacitors performances and behaviors for long term analysis. We quantity their impacts on battery lifetime and on the levelized cost of electricity of our storage system. This analysis has been validated on the micro-grid developed in LAASCNRS in ADREAM building integrated photovoltaic. The power profiles used for our work correspond to 1 years production and consumption data from 100m2 floor of the building.

In this chapter we make a survey on this issue about blockchain systems. Security of the current systems is based on the computational hardness assumptions and many of the standard cryptography systems are known to be vulnerable against the advent of full-fledged quantum computers. On the other hand, it is possible to make a blockchain more secure by virtue of quantum information technology. In this chapter we give a pedagogical introduction to quantum information theory and quantum computation so that readers can follow advanced researches on application of quantum technology to the blockchain industry. We also explain a novel information system which accommodates quantum states in a peer-to-peer way. It would improve the level of privacy and security by the laws of physics, which is never achievable from nonquantum information theoretic viewpoints.","2018","2022-05-11 15:39:17","2022-05-16 20:21:28","","199-228","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/bs.adcom.2018.03.003","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These objectives always need to be balanced during selection, leading to a process of multi-objective optimization. What’s more, the massive complex dependency and constraint relationships between features present another huge challenge for optimization. Objective: In this work, we propose a multi-objective optimization algorithm, IVEA-II, to automatically search through configurations to obtain an optimal balance between various objectives. Additionally, all the relationships between features must be conformed to by the optimal feature solutions. Method: Firstly, a two-dimensional fitness function in our previous work is reserved. Secondly, to prevent the negative impact of this 2D fitness on the diversity of final Pareto Fronts, the crowding distance is introduced into each fitness-based selection. Lastly, a new mutation operator is designed to improve the scalability of IVEA-II. Results: A series of experiments were conducted to verify the effectiveness of IVEA-II on five large-scale feature models with five optimization goals. Conclusion: Experiments showed that IVEA-II can generate more valid solutions over a set period of time, with optimal solutions also having better diversity and convergence.","2018","2022-05-04 12:38:35","2022-05-16 20:12:50","","636-651","","","137","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Automatic analysis of radiographs can lead to efficient and accurate diagnosis of dental problems. Teeth segmentation of panoramic radiographs is one of the most crucial tasks to localize impacted teeth, identify untreated root canals and to detect fractured teeth. Multilevel thresholding based image segmentation is considered here to segment the teeth from the dental x-ray images. In this paper, a quantum computing based computational intelligence technique i.e. quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) is introduced for multilevel image thresholding of dental x-ray images. Results demonstrate that the proposed method provides a useful and reliable tool for such multilevel thresholding based image segmentation.","2018-12","2022-05-11 15:42:23","2022-05-16 19:22:22","","1148-1153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8EUN3873\Mahdi and Kobashi - 2018 - Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization for Multilevel.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Optimization; Quantum computing; Particle swarm optimization; optimization; quantum particle swarm optimization; Image segmentation; image segmentation; dental radiographs; Dentistry; multilevel image thresholding; Teeth; Thresholding (Imaging)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 Joint 10th International Conference on Soft Computing and Intelligent Systems (SCIS) and 19th International Symposium on Advanced Intelligent Systems (ISIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

These applications require the high quality of different network resources such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss rate. In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.","2018","2022-05-04 12:34:44","2022-05-16 19:11:24","","128-139","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12","<p>https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01913908/file/467079_1_En_12_Chapter.pdf</p>","","","included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The optimal short-term hydrothermal scheduling (STHS) aims to attain optimal production scheduling of thermal and hydro plants for determining minimum operation cost of providing demand in the determined time interval. Different constraints should be studied in the solution of such issue containing limitations associated with water discharge, water storage, power production of plants, power balance of the system and water balance of hydro plants. In addition, valve impacts of thermal plants and complex hydraulic coupling of hydro plants are the other operational and technical constraints. In this study, the robust stochastic STHS is studied considering market price and demand uncertainties. Accordingly, robust optimization method is employed in this study to model price uncertainties. In addition, the uncertainties of load demand are handled using scenario-based modeling procedure. The scheduling problem of hydrothermal system is studied in a deregulated environment, where the hydrothermal system belongs to the private company and is capable to sell the surplus generated power to the market. Accordingly, the company aims to obtain maximum profit by selling power to market in addition to supplying power demand of the company. The introduced scheme for stochastic robust STHS is simulated and the provided solutions are investigated to verify the effectiveness of the scheme.","2018","2022-05-11 15:23:28","2022-05-16 19:10:28","","168-179","","4","2","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://dergipark.org.tr/en/download/article-file/576512</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, the existing TP techniques usually only produce a static test case order before the execution without taking runtime test case execution results into account. In this paper, we propose an approach for black-box dynamic TP using rule mining and multi-objective search (named as REMAP). REMAP has three key components: 1) Rule Miner, which mines execution relations among test cases from historical execution data; 2) Static Prioritizer, which defines two objectives (i.e., fault detection capability (FDC) and test case reliance score (TRS)) and applies multi-objective search to prioritize test cases statically; and 3) Dynamic Executor and Prioritizer, which executes statically-prioritized test cases and dynamically updates the test case order based on the runtime test case execution results. We empirically evaluated REMAP with random search, greedy based on FDC, greedy based on FDC and TRS, static search-based prioritization, and rule-based prioritization using two industrial and three open source case studies. Results showed that REMAP significantly outperformed the other approaches for 96% of the case studies and managed to achieve on average 18% higher Average Percentage of Faults Detected (APFD).","2018","2022-05-04 12:38:39","2022-05-16 19:04:07","","46-57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This approach has been applied to model-based testing of Software Product Line (SPL). The strategy is to generate a set of product configurations to achieve high t-wise coverage for satisfying test objective. The number of valid combinations increases explosively with the increase of interaction strength. Therefore, how to choose the minimum number of product configuration to achieve maximum t-wise coverage is the complex problem in high-strength feature interaction. This paper introduces a multi-objective method to solve such problem. We use three objectives to decide product selection: t-wise coverage, number of products and similarity. Our method can generate a set of solutions quickly and the maximum t-wise coverage can be achieved with the smallest number of products.","2018","2022-05-04 12:38:42","2022-05-16 19:03:50","","370-378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This model, trained on more than 20,000 individual restaurants, has an accuracy of 97% and a ROC (AUC) score of 75%. An AUC score above 70% is ordinarily classified as a “fair model” in performance. Using the prediction model, we can also quantify the most predictive variables and higher order variable interaction, both of which produce further compelling insights into non-linear relationships. A model that predicts facility closures has implications for both equity and debt providers.

Inspired by space projection behavior, this paper suggests a new PSO variant, Multiple-shadows Layered Cooperative Velocity Updating Particle Swarm Optimization (ML-CVUPSO) that involves visual instructive projections among multiple shadows. According to several different views, the original problem can be divided into different relevant characteristic sub-problems after feature extraction. The ML-CVUPSO provides a flexible and feasible decomposed mechanism to simplify the high dimensions problem into a series of tractable sub-problems. The proposed variant is examined on several widely used benchmark functions, and the experimental results show that the proposed ML-CVUPSO algorithm improves the existing performance of other algorithms when dealing with the high dimension and multimodal problems.","2018","2022-05-05 17:54:48","2022-05-16 18:57:47","","99-112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-57421-9_9","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, we aim to propose a novel software test case automatic generation technology to promote the quality of software testing. The main innovation of this paper lies in that we introduce the PSO algorithm to generate software case. Particularly, in order to enhance the performance of PSO, we propose an improved PSO algorithm, in which the position and velocity of each particle represented as vectors in the multiple dimensional binary solution space. Afterwards, a novel software test case automatic generation algorithm based on PSO is proposed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is able to obtain both high performance and lower time cost in software test case automatic generation.","2018-08","2022-05-11 15:41:56","2022-05-16 18:57:30","","156-159","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","IEEE Xplore","","","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\RGT3C3IJ\8531372.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\MU3H6EDI\Wang and Liu - 2018 - A Software Test Case Automatic Generation Technolo.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Particle swarm optimization; Software algorithms; Resistance heating; Water heating; Software testing; Software; Heat engines; Software test case, Automatic generation, Particle swarm optimization, Random number","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","2018 International Conference on Virtual Reality and Intelligent Systems (ICVRIS)","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Taking a 20-story steel frame structure as an example, seismic failure modes are identified and optimized using this method. Results indicate that global damage to the optimized structure is reduced under 62% earthquake excitations, while the hysteretic energy dissipation capacity of the optimized structure is improved under 48.3% earthquake excitations. Furthermore, the distribution of the optimized structure’s inter-story drift ratio is more uniform than in the original structure, leading to a significant improvement of the structural seismic performance.","2018-10-01","2022-05-05 18:25:51","2022-05-16 18:56:47","2022-05-05 18:25:51","2005-2017","","13","21","","Advances in Structural Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","SAGE Journals","","Publisher: SAGE Publications Ltd STM","<p>Cited By :3</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\K4UKTRDS\Xu et al. - 2018 - Seismic failure mode identification and multi-obje.pdf","","excluded; not an application","multi-objective optimization; damage index; failure mode identification; hysteretic energy; steel frame structure","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Dari lima tahun terakhir, rata-rata pertumbuhan jumlah ritel berjumlah 1167 unit per tahun. Saat ini, terdapat 220 titik ritel berdiri di Kalimantan dan hanya dilayani oleh satu buah pusat distribusi yang menjadikan kondisi ini tidak relevan lagi. Sehingga, paper ini membahas tentang penentuan lokasi pusat distribusi yang kedua. Algoritma K-Means Clustering digunakan untuk memecah dua kelompok lokasi, setelah itu dilakukan perhitungan centroid dengan menggunakan Center of Gravity untuk masing-masing cluster. Penelitian ini mengasumsikan bahwa permintaan untuk masing-masing kota didekati dengan jumlah penduduk kota tersebut. Pada kondisi nyata, dalam satu kota terdapat beberapa ritel, sehingga data permintaan satu kota diperoleh dengan membagi jumlah penduduk terhadap jumlah ritel yang ada. Pada cluster 1 titik centroid terletak pada Kabupaten Landak, yang berjarak 149 km dari lokasi pusat distribusi yang sudah ada dengan akses masuk barang terdekat dari Pelabuhan Dwikora. Pada cluster 2, titik centroid jatuh pada Kabupaten Balangan dengan akses masuk barang terdekat yaitu dari Bandar Udara Syamsudin Noor.","2017-02-04","2022-05-11 14:36:06","2022-05-16 20:45:41","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ResearchGate","","","","","https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Filscha-Nurprihatin/publication/316189842_Algoritma_K-Means_Clustering_untuk_Menentukan_Lokasi_Pusat_Distribusi_Ritel_dengan_Mempertimbangkan_Jumlah_Permintaan/links/6108f4fb1e95fe241aa62cca/Algoritma-K-Means-Clustering-untuk-Menentukan-Lokasi-Pusat-Distribusi-Ritel-dengan-Mempertimbangkan-Jumlah-Permintaan.pdf","excluded; not english","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"ZTYGJJXQ","journalArticle","2017","Patvardhan, C.; Bansal, Sulabh; Srivastav, Anand","Towards the right amount of randomness in quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms","Soft Computing","","","10.1007/s00500-015-1880-5","https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013589196","Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithms (QIEAs) combine the advantages of quantum-inspired bit (Q-bit), representation and operators with evolutionary algorithms for better performance. Using quantum-inspired representation the complete binary search space can be generated by collapsing a single Q-bit string repeatedly. Thus, even a population size of 1 can be taken in a QIEA implementation resulting in enormous saving in computation. Although this is correct in theory, QIEA implementations run into trouble in exploring large search spaces with this approach. The Q-bit string has to be initialized to produce each possible binary string with equal probability and then altered slowly to probabilistically favor generation of strings with better fitness values. This process is unacceptably slow when the search spaces are very large. Many ideas have been reported with EAs/QIEAs for speeding up convergence while ensuring that the algorithm does not get stuck in local optima. In this paper, the possible features are identified and systematically introduced and tested in the QIEA framework in various combinations. Some of these features increase the randomness in the search process for better exploration and the others compensate by local search for better exploitation together enabling a judicious combination tailored for particular problem being solved. This is referred to as “right-sizing the randomness” in the QIEA search. Benchmark instances of the well-known and well-studied Quadratic Knapsack Problem are used to demonstrate how effective these features are—individually and collectively. The new framework, dubbed QIEA-QKP, is shown to be much more effective than canonical QIEA. The framework can be utilized with profit on other problems and is being attempted.","2017","2022-05-11 14:25:33","2022-05-16 20:43:54","","1765-1784","","7","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\8HACIXBE\Patvardhan et al. - 2017 - Towards the right amount of randomness in quantum-.pdf","","excluded; not a primary study","Combinatorial optimization; Quantum-inspired evolutionary algorithm; Evolutionary algorithm; Quadratic Knapsack Problem","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, existing multi-objective search algorithms have certain randomness when selecting parent solutions for producing offspring solutions. In the worse case, suboptimal parent solutions may result in offspring solutions with bad quality, and thus affect the overall quality of the next generation. To address such a challenge, we propose a cluster-based genetic algorithm with elitist selection (CBGA-ES) with the aim to reduce such randomness for supporting multi-objective test optimization. We empirically compared CBGA-ES with random search, greedy (as baselines) and four commonly used multi-objective search algorithms (e.g., NSGA-II) using two industrial and one real world test optimization problem, i.e., test suite minimization, test case prioritization, and test case selection. The results showed that CBGA-ES significantly outperformed the baseline algorithms (e.g., greedy), and the four selected search algorithms for all the three test optimization problems. CBGA-ES managed to outperform more than 75% of the objectives for all the four algorithms in each test optimization problem. Moreover, CBGA-ES was able to improve the quality of the solutions for an average of 32.5% for each objective as compared to the four algorithms for the three test optimization problems.","2017","2022-05-04 12:38:38","2022-05-16 20:43:41","","367-378","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The main purpose of this study is to identify the accounting patterns associated with bankruptcy. The filing outcomes include, among other things, how long the bankruptcy process will endure, whether the firm will successfully emerge after the bankruptcy period, whether the bankruptcy is tortuous and whether it will involve asset sales. The study highlights the importance of previously unidentified variables useful in predicting bankruptcies and bankruptcy outcomes. The study categorises predictor variables in accounting dimensions to empirically identify the importance of each dimension to the prediction tasks. The high-dimensionality of the gradient boosting machine allows us to identify and explain the nonlinear interactions between a wide range of variables to get a sense of the most important combinations.","2017","2022-05-04 14:59:33","2022-05-16 20:39:57","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Surprises that deviate 15% or more can be predicted with 71% accuracy. These predictions can be used to earn abnormal profits. A machine learning regression model that incorporates pricing, analyst forecasts, and earnings information provides a better estimate of future earnings per share than that of consensus analyst forecasts and mechanical time-series models alone; with errors as much as 46% lower than analysts over certain periods. The machine learning model uses signal-processed and earnings-related variables. Some of these variables have been noted in past research to be related to analyst bias. The machine learning model in effect corrects for analyst mistakes and biases by incorporating these variables into a nonlinear prediction model that lowers the overall forecast error for all periods concerned. Machine learning models aid the identification of analyst biases by identifying variables that are important in predicting earnings over and above analysts' consensus forecast.","2017","2022-05-04 14:59:33","2022-05-16 20:39:56","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In order to obtain a precise finite element (FE) model of those complex bridge structures, the practical hybrid updating method by integration of Gaussian mutation particle swarm optimization (GMPSO), Kriging meta-model and Latin hypercube sampling (LHS) was proposed. By demonstrating the efficiency and accuracy of the hybrid method through the model updating of a damaged simply supported beam, the proposed method was applied to the model updating of a self-anchored suspension bridge with extra-width which showed great necessity considering the results of ambient vibration test. The results of bridge model updating showed that both of the mode frequencies and shapes had relatively high agreement between the updated model and experimental structure. The successful model updating of this bridge fills in the blanks of model updating of a complex self-anchored suspension bridge.

Ice disasters on transmission lines can cause gap discharge and icing flashover electrical failures, which can lead to mechanical failure of the tower, conductor, and insulators, causing significant harm to people’s daily life and work. To address this challenge, an intelligent combinational model is proposed based on improved empirical mode decomposition and support vector machine for short-term forecasting of ice cover thickness. Firstly, in light of the characteristics of ice cover thickness data, fast independent component analysis (FICA) is implemented to smooth the abnormal situation on the curve trend of the original data for prediction. Secondly, ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD) decomposes data after denoising it into different components from high frequency to low frequency, and support vector machine (SVM) is introduced to predict the sequence of different components. Then, some modifications are performed on the standard SVM algorithm to accelerate the convergence speed. Combined with the advantages of genetic algorithm and tabu search, the combination algorithm is introduced to optimize the parameters of support vector machine. To improve the prediction accuracy, the kernel function of the support vector machine is adaptively adopted according to the complexity of different sequences. Finally, prediction results for each component series are added to obtain the overall ice cover thickness. A 220 kV DC transmission line in the Hunan Region is taken as the case study to verify the practicability and effectiveness of the proposed method. Meanwhile, we select SVM optimized by genetic algorithm (GA-SVM) and traditional SVM algorithm for comparison, and use the error function of mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) to compare prediction accuracy. Finally, we find that these improvements facilitate the forecasting efficiency and improve the performance of the model. As a result, the proposed model obtains more ideal solutions and has higher accuracy and stronger generalization than other algorithms.","2017-11","2022-05-11 15:01:44","2022-05-16 20:36:04","2022-05-11 15:01:44","1862","","11","10","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 11 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\3ARJBD56\Xu et al. - 2017 - Ice Cover Prediction of a Power Grid Transmission .pdf","","excluded; not an application","adaptive support vector machine (ASVM); ensemble empirical mode decomposition; fast independent component analysis; genetic tabu search (GATS); ice cover prediction; two-stage data processing","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Thus, managing the energy is important, especially for autonomous installations, for which a precise balance between the PV power generated and the power demanded by the load is required. In this chapter, a Fuzzy Management Algorithm for the optimum operation of a PV irrigation system composed of PVPs, a lead–acid battery bank, and a submerged pump, is presented and validated experimentally. The algorithm makes decisions on the interconnection time of the PVP, the battery bank, and the pump, depending on the PV power generated, the battery dod, and the stored water in the reservoir. The control algorithm aims to ensure a continuous pump supply and the battery bank protection against deep discharge and excessive charge. The algorithm effectiveness is then tested on a specific case study, during the vegetative cycle of tomatoes (from March to July), and using data from the target location.","2017","2022-05-04 12:25:03","2022-05-16 20:35:45","","93-120","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-12-812039-2.00004-1","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

From cybernetics viewpoint, the work is mainly on the first-order level, namely, the software under observation and control. Beyond the first-order cybernetics, the software, developers/users, and running environments influence each other and thus create feedback to form more complicated systems. We classify software cybernetics as Software Cybernetics I based on the first-order cybernetics, and as Software Cybernetics II based on the higher order cybernetics. This paper provides a review of the literature on software cybernetics, particularly focusing on the transition from Software Cybernetics I to Software Cybernetics II. The results of the survey indicate that some new research areas such as Internet of Things, big data, cloud computing, cyber-physical systems, and even creative computing are related to Software Cybernetics II. The paper identifies the relationships between the techniques of Software Cybernetics II applied and the new research areas to which they have been applied, formulates research problems and challenges of software cybernetics with the application of principles of Phase II of software cybernetics; identifies and highlights new research trends of software cybernetic for further research.","2017","2022-05-04 12:38:34","2022-05-16 20:35:31","","169-186","","","124","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/9352/1/9352.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Solution of MKP involves two levels of choice – one for selecting an item to be placed and the other for selecting the knapsack in which it is to be placed. Quantum Inspired Evolutionary Algorithms (QIEAs), a subclass of Evolutionary algorithms, have been shown to be effective in solving difficult problems particularly NP-hard combinatorial optimization problems. QIEAs provide a general framework which needs to be customized according to the requirements of a given problem to obtain good solutions in reasonable time. An existing QIEA for MKP (QIEA-MKP) is based on the representation where a Q-bit collapse into a binary number. But decimal numbers are required to identify the knapsack where an item is placed. The implementation based on such representation suffers from overhead of frequent conversion from binary numbers to decimal numbers and vice versa. The generalized QIEA (GQIEA) is based on a representation where a Q-bit can collapse into an integer and thus no inter conversion between binary and decimal is required. A set of carefully selected features have been incorporated in proposed GQIEA-MKP to obtain better solutions in lesser time. Comparison with QIEA-MKP shows that GQIEA-MKP outperforms it in providing better solutions in lesser time for large sized MKPs. The generalization proposed can be used with advantage in other Combinatorial Optimization problems with integer strings as solutions.","2018","2022-05-04 12:07:48","2022-05-16 20:32:57","","17-51","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CINB8WFG\201585.html","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective To solve search-based software engineering (SE) problems, using fewer evaluations than evolutionary methods. Method Instead of mutating a small population, we build a very large initial population which is then culled using a recursive bi-clustering chop approach. We evaluate this approach on multiple SE models, unconstrained as well as constrained, and compare its performance with standard evolutionary algorithms. Results Using just a few evaluations (under 100), we can obtain comparable results to state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms. Conclusion Just because something works, and is widespread use, does not necessarily mean that there is no value in seeking methods to improve that method. Before undertaking search-based SE optimization tasks using traditional EAs, it is recommended to try other techniques, like those explored here, to obtain the same results with fewer evaluations.","2018","2022-05-04 12:38:37","2022-05-16 20:32:09","","281-294","","","95","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1701.07950</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper we solve the bi-objective problem in which both models are simultaneously optimized. No previous effort has been devoted to study the “combined problem” from a multi-objective perspective.

The obnoxious p-median is an interesting variant that appears in the context of hazardous location. The aim of this paper is to formally introduce a bi-objective optimization model for this problem, in which a solution consists of a set of p locations, and two conflicting objectives arise. On the one hand, the sum of the minimum distance between each client and their nearest open facility and, on the other hand, the dispersion among facilities. Both objective values should be kept as large as possible for a convenient location of dangerous facilities. We propose a Multi-Objective Memetic Algorithm (MOMA) to obtain high-quality approximations to the efficient front of the bi-objective obnoxious p-median problem, denoted as Bi-OpM. In particular, we introduce efficient crossover and mutation mechanisms. Additionally, we present several multi-objective local search methods. All the strategies are finally incorporated in a memetic algorithm which limits the search to the feasible region, thus performing an efficient exploration of the solutions space. Our experimentation compares several state-of-the-art procedures with the introduced MOMA emerging as the best performing method in all considered multi-objective metrics.","2018","2022-05-04 12:38:39","2022-05-16 20:31:58","","88-101","","","144","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

"25AEXDFG","journalArticle","2018","Falcone, Roberto","Optimal seismic retrofitting of existing RC frames through soft-computing approaches","","","","10.14273/unisa-1375","http://elea.unisa.it:8080/xmlui/handle/10556/3092","Ph.D. Thesis proposes a Soft-Computing approach capable of supporting the engineer judgement in the selection and  design of the cheapest solution for seismic retrofitting of existing RC framed structure. Chapter 1 points out the need for  strengthening the existing buildings as one of the main way of decreasing economic and life losses as direct  consequences of earthquake disasters. Moreover, it proposes a wide, but not-exhaustive, list of the most frequently  observed deficiencies contributing to the vulnerability of concrete buildings. Chapter 2 collects the state of practice on  seismic analysis methods for the assessment the safety of the existing buildings within the framework of a performancebased  design. The most common approaches for modeling the material plasticity in the frame non-linear analysis are  also reviewed. Chapter 3 presents a wide state of practice on the retrofitting strategies, intended as preventive measures  aimed at mitigating the effect of a future earthquake by a) decreasing the seismic hazard demands; b) improving the  dynamic characteristics supplied to the existing building. The chapter presents also a list of retrofitting systems,  intended as technical interventions commonly classified into local intervention (also known “member-level”  techniques) and global intervention (also called “structure-level” techniques) that might be used in synergistic  combination to achieve the adopted strategy. In particular, the available approaches and the common criteria,  respectively for selecting an optimum retrofit strategy and an optimal system are discussed. Chapter 4 highlights the  usefulness of the Soft-Computing methods as efficient tools for providing “objective” answer in reasonable time for  complex situation governed by approximation and imprecision. In particular, Chapter 4 collects the applications found  in the scientific literature for Fuzzy Logic, Artificial Neural Network and Evolutionary Computing in the fields of  structural and earthquake engineering with a taxonomic classification of the problems in modeling, simulation and  optimization. Chapter 5 “translates” the search for the cheapest retrofitting system into a constrained optimization  problem. To this end, the chapter includes a formulation of a novel procedure that assembles a numerical model for  seismic assessment of framed structures within a Soft-Computing-driven optimization algorithm capable to minimize  the objective function defined as the total initial cost of intervention. The main components required to assemble the  procedure are described in the chapter: the optimization algorithm (Genetic Algorithm); the simulation framework  (OpenSees); and the software environment (Matlab). Chapter 6 describes step-by-step the flow-chart of the proposed  procedure and it focuses on the main implementation aspects and working details, ranging from a clever initialization of  the population of candidate solutions up to a proposal of tuning procedure for the genetic parameters. Chapter 7  discusses numerical examples, where the Soft-Computing procedure is applied to the model of multi-storey RC frames  obtained through simulated design. A total of fifteen “scenarios” are studied in order to assess its “robustness” to  changes in input data. Finally, Chapter 8, on the base of the outcomes observed, summarizes the capabilities of the  proposed procedure, yet highlighting its “limitations” at the current state of development. Some possible modifications  are discussed to enhance its efficiency and completeness.

Complex problems in science, engineering, or business are being solved by teams of people working closely with one another. However, forming teams of experts is a computationally challenging problem that requires powerful solution techniques. A metaheuristic algorithm that incorporates some of the principles of quantum computing into an evolutionary structure is presented. The resulting Quantum Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA) has the ability to produce an adequate balance between intensification and diversification during the search process. Numerical experiments have shown that the QEA is able to significantly improve the quality of the solutions for hard instances of the team formation problem, particularly when compared to a standard genetic algorithm. The successful performance of the algorithm requires careful parameter tuning, as well as a mechanism to effectively share information across the population of candidate solutions.","2019-09-24","2022-05-04 12:19:31","2022-05-16 16:11:37","2022-05-04 12:19:31","","","","","","","","","","","","","","eng","","","","","e-spacio.uned.es","","Publisher: Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (España).

However the combination of complex techniques, diverse reporting standards and poorly understood underlying phenomena are causing some concern as to the reliability of studies. Objective Our goal is to provide guidance for producers and consumers of software analytics studies (computational experiments and correlation studies). Method We propose using “bad smells”, i.e., surface indications of deeper problems and popular in the agile software community and consider how they may be manifest in software analytics studies. Results We list 12 “bad smells” in software analytics papers (and show their impact by examples). Conclusions We believe the metaphor of bad smell is a useful device. Therefore we encourage more debate on what contributes to the validity of software analytics studies (so we expect our list will mature over time).","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:41","2022-05-16 15:48:04","","35-47","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05518</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, it is recognised that some maintenance, especially refactoring, can be automated. Given the number of possible refactorings and combinations of refactorings, a search-based approach may provide the means to optimise refactorings. Objective This paper describes the investigation of a many-objective genetic algorithm used to automate software refactoring, implemented as a Java tool, MultiRefactor. Method The approach and tool is evaluated using a set of open source Java programs. The tool contains four separate measures of software looking at the software quality as well as measures of code priority, refactoring coverage and element recentness. The many-objective algorithm combines the four objectives to improve the software in a holistic manner. An experiment has been constructed to compare the many-objective approach against a mono-objective approach that only uses a single objective to measure software quality. Different permutations of the objectives are also tested and compared to see how well the different objectives can work together in a multi-objective refactoring approach. The eight approaches are tested on six different open source Java programs. Results The many-objective approach is found to give better objective scores on average than the mono-objective approach and in less time. However, the priority and element recentness objectives are both found to be less successful in multi/many-objective setups when they are used together. Conclusion A many-objective approach is suitable and effective for optimising automated refactoring to improve quality. Including other objectives does not unduly degrade the quality improvements, but is less effective for those objectives than if they were used in a mono-objective approach.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:41","2022-05-16 15:47:15","","83-101","","","112","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/168357425/MohanGreerRefactoring.ISTR2.4.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

ABSTRACT: Multi-objective optimization has a wide range of applications in science and engineering. Evolutionary algorithms have been widely used to solve problems of multiple objectives. In order to improve the balance between exploration and exploitation of the search space, evolutionary algorithms have adopted some concepts and principles of quantum computing, such as qubits and superposition of states, originating a new class of algorithms called quantum-Inspired evolutionary algorithms, which combine the mechanisms of quantum computing and evolutionary computation and are designed to run on a classical computer.  In this thesis, the design and implementation of a quantum-inspired multi-objective evolutionary algorithm that uses a single quantum register and the Hadamard quantum gate to evolve the set of solutions towards the optimal Pareto front is presented. The proposed algorithm is based on a classical evolutionary algorithm and modifying the representation of the individuals and the recombination mechanism since it does not require any additional genetic operator.  The proposed technique was evaluated through several experiments using benchmark  problems and an engineering problem. This algorithm was compared against a conventional quantum-inspired multi-objective evolutionary algorithm and a classical multi-objective evolutionary algorithm. For experiments with benchmark problems, the results obtained by the proposed method are comparable to those reported in the state-of-the-art in terms of convergence and diversity, according to the generational distance, distribution, and hypervolume metrics. In some cases, better results were obtained according to the distribution metric.

In our earlier work, we proposed an approach for black-box dynamic TP using rule mining and multi-objective search (named as REMAP) by defining two objectives (fault detection capability and test case reliance score) and considering test case execution results at runtime. In this paper, we conduct an extensive empirical evaluation of REMAP by employing three different rule mining algorithms and three different multi-objective search algorithms, and we also evaluate REMAP with one additional objective (estimated execution time) for a total of 18 different configurations (i.e., 3 rule mining algorithms × 3 search algorithms × 2 different set of objectives) of REMAP. Specifically, we empirically evaluated the 18 variants of REMAP with 1) two variants of random search while using two objectives and three objectives, 2) three variants of greedy algorithm based on one objective, two objectives, and three objectives, 3) 18 variants of static search-based prioritization approaches, and 4) six variants of rule-based prioritization approaches using two industrial and three open source case studies. Results showed that the two best variants of REMAP with two objectives and three objectives significantly outperformed the best variants of competing approaches by 84.4% and 88.9%, and managed to achieve on average 14.2% and 18.8% higher Average Percentage of Faults Detected per Cost (APFDc ) scores.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:41","2022-05-16 15:43:52","","86-104","","","153","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This makes testing highly configurable systems very expensive and time-consuming. Objective Driven by our industrial collaboration with a video conferencing company, we aim to automatically analyze and implant existing test cases (i.e., an original test suite) to test the untested configurations. Method We propose a search-based test case implantation approach (named as SBI) consisting of two key components: 1) Test case analyzer that statically analyzes each test case in the original test suite to obtain the program dependence graph for test case statements and 2) Test case implanter that uses multi-objective search to select suitable test cases for implantation using three operators, i.e., selection, crossover, and mutation (at the test suite level) and implants the selected test cases using a mutation operator at the test case level including three operations (i.e., addition, modification, and deletion). Results We empirically evaluated SBI with an industrial case study and an open source case study by comparing the implanted test suites produced by three variants of SBI with the original test suite using evaluation metrics such as statement coverage (SC), branch coverage (BC), and mutation score (MS). Results show that for both the case studies, the test suites implanted by the three variants of SBI performed significantly better than the original test suites. The best variant of SBI achieved on average 19.3% higher coverage of configuration variable values for both the case studies. Moreover, for the open source case study, the best variant of SBI managed to improve SC, BC, and MS with 5.0%, 7.9%, and 3.2%, respectively. Conclusion SBI can be applied to automatically implant a test suite with the aim of testing untested configurations and thus achieving higher configuration coverage.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:40","2022-05-16 15:43:47","","22-36","","","111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, the CEED must be handled after considering two challenging goals such as the costs involved with emission and fuel. In this paper, chaotic self-adaptive interior search algorithm (CSAISA) was proposed to solve the CEED problems, considering the nonlinear behavior of generators in terms of valve point effects, prohibited operating zones, and security constraints. The proposed algorithm was tested for its effectiveness using 11-generating units (without security), IEEE-30 bus system, and IEEE-118 bus system with security constraints. The results of the proposed CSAISA were compared with interior search algorithm (ISA), harmony search algorithm (HSA), differential evolution (DE), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and genetic algorithm (GA). To conclude, the proposed CSAISA outperformed all other algorithms in terms of convergence speed, implementation time, and solution quality, which was tested using performance metrics.","2019","2022-05-11 15:42:48","2022-05-16 15:43:13","2022-05-11 15:42:48","e12026","","8","29","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2050-7038.12026","<p>Cited By :14</p>; <p>e12026 ITEES-18-0713.R1</p>; <p>e12026 ITEES-18-0713.R1</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","combined economic emission dispatch; chaotic self-adaptive interior search algorithm; interior search algorithm; multiobjective optimization problem; performance metrics; security constraints","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Interpolative Boolean algebra is a real-valued generalization of Boolean algebra. After an extensive overview of the theoretical framework, we present two interpolative Boolean-based methods: logical clustering and logical DuPont. Both methods are extended to address portfolio selection problems. Logical clustering method for portfolio selection employs interpolative Boolean algebra dissimilarity within a hierarchical clustering algorithm to group companies according to investment ratios. Further, this method uses expert logic-based rules for investment decision making. Logical DuPont method for portfolio selection is applied to give insight into the structure of companyís earnings and further identify profit drivers to recommend investment actions. The presented methods are validated on S&P 500 stock market data. Logical clustering and logical DuPont methods have proven to be valuable fuzzy tools for an automated stock selection.","2019","2022-05-04 14:59:31","2022-05-16 15:43:06","","23-46","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-03368-2_2","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Since investigating the subject five years ago, there has been an almost exponential progress in academic interest. When I first started thinking about machine learning in finance, formal research was sparse, to say the least. As a result, I have had the luxury to pick from a broad range of topics and decided to investigate financial event prediction using machine learning, giving rise to the eponymous title.FinML research can loosely be divided into four streams. The first concerns asset price prediction where researchers attempt to predict the future value of securities using a machine learning methodology. The second stream involves predicting hard or soft financial events like earnings surprises, corporate defaults, and mergers and acquisitions. The third stream entails the prediction and or estimation of values not directly related to the price of a security, such as future revenue, firm valuation, credit ratings, etc. The fourth and last stream comprises the use of machine learning techniques to solve traditional optimisation problems in finance like optimal execution and the optimal construction of portfolios. This thesis, in particular, focuses on the use of machine learning in financial event prediction. In the past, finance academics had to be content with mostly linear models that could only ingest a small number of variables of a particular type. Now we can use non-linear models with a larger number of variables and more versatile data types. In this thesis, I show how machine learning can lead to significant improvements in financial event prediction, more specifically, in earnings surprise, bankruptcy and facility closure predictions, all of which have significant financial implications for the businesses and stakeholders alike.","2019","2022-05-04 14:59:35","2022-05-16 15:40:49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

While it has been successfully proven that such systems can in general be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems, they have not been used to solve chemistry applications. In this paper we apply a mapping, put forward by Xia et al. [25], from a quantum chemistry Hamiltonian to an Ising spin glass formulation and find the ground state energy with a quantum annealer. Additionally we investigate the scaling in terms of needed physical qubits on a quantum annealer with limited connectivity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first experimental study of quantum chemistry problems on quantum annealing devices. We find that current quantum annealing technologies result in an exponential scaling for such inherently quantum problems and that new couplers are necessary to make quantum annealers attractive for quantum chemistry.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:19","2022-05-16 15:40:09","","111-122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-14082-3_10","<p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.05256</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To address this challenging problem, a novel social cognitive optimization algorithm with tent map (TSCO) is presented for solving the CHPED problem. To handle the equality constraints in heat and power balance constraints, adaptive constraints relaxing rule is adopted in constraint processing. The novelty of our work lies in the introduction of a new powerful TSCO algorithm to solve the CHPED issue. The effectiveness and superiority of the presented algorithm is validated by conducting 2 typical CHPED cases.

First a simplified planar finite element model is built for container cranes. In order to mitigate the seismic responses, buckling restrained braces (BRB), instead of ordinary braces, are used in the model. Two performance criteria are considered and the deformations of structural elements are selected to define the performance criteria. The pattern search method is employed to efficiently solve the optimization task. The result indicates that the structural weight of container cranes can be remarkably reduced while satisfying multiple performance requirements.

In this research, we will evidence that nonlinear constraints of generating units, forbidden regions, and ramp-rate of generating units will reduce operational costs and environmental pollution, to achieve environmental economic dispatch effectiveness, by employing an improved multi-objective optimization algorithm based on human social behavior. With reward and penalty learning factors leading to excellent particles matting and optimization capability to achieve optimal solution, data transactions among particles have been conducted in the suggested approach. To get a more effective comparable result from the recommended algorithm, we conducted simulation experiments on IEEE 10-bus power systems in different load levels. Then we compared the outcomes with those other algorithms that were validated. The results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve diverse Pareto optimal solutions, fast convergence and high robustness, and unlikely to be trapped in local minima. It is revealed that the proposed technique is superior in terms of accuracy and speed in solving power system complex problems over the other methods.","2019","2022-05-11 16:32:02","2022-05-16 15:28:12","2022-05-11 16:32:02","1599-1607","","7","18","","Environ.

Using a (1+1)-CMA-ES algorithm, we are able to improve the performance of the QPU by up to a factor of 12.4 in probability of obtaining ground states for small problems, and obtain previously inaccessible (i.e., better) solutions for larger problems. We also make efficient use of QPU samples as a resource, using 100 times less resources than existing tuning methods. The success of this approach demonstrates how quantum computing can benefit from classical algorithms, and opens the door to new hybrid methods of computing.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:19","2022-05-16 15:16:11","","157-168","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-14082-3_14","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed approach minimizes construction cost and takes member plastic rotation and optionally inter-story drift as optimization constraints. Other seismic design requirements reflecting successful design practice are also incorporated. Simplification is made by reducing design variables into two, one for overall system stiffness and the other for overall system strength. The optimization contains two stages, the determination of feasible region boundary in strength and stiffness domain and optimization in material consumption domain. Capacity spectrum method, which jointly considers nonlinear static analysis and inelastic design spectrum, is used to estimate the global and local deformation demands at peak dynamic response. The proposed optimization approach is applied to the design of a six-story reinforced concrete frame. The design results indicate that 30% of needed flexural strength and 26% of cross-sectional area can be reduced from the initial strength-based design. Nonlinear time-history analyses are conducted on the optimized structure using ten historical ground motions scaled to represent three levels of seismic hazard.","2019-04-15","2022-05-05 18:24:30","2022-05-16 15:14:41","2022-05-05 18:24:30","15-25","","","185","","Engineering Structures","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :9</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\BLF759EY\Zhang and Tian - 2019 - Simplified performance-based optimal seismic desig.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\WNACLXMG\S0141029618332140.html","","excluded; not an application","Optimal design; Performance-based design; Nonlinear static analysis; Cost; Frame; Inelastic spectrum; Reinforced concrete","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To improve the quality of WPIP, a novel fuzzy interval prediction model (FIPM) based on the lower upper bound estimation method is proposed in this paper. In the frame of the FIPM, a novel inter type-2 (IT-2) fuzzy model is designed to construct the lower and upper bounds of the prediction interval (PI), in which an IT-2 fuzzy c-regression algorithm is used to partition the data space and identify the fuzzy model. The gravitational search algorithm is employed to optimize the FIPM by minimizing coverage width-based criterion to reach a tradeoff between the interval width and coverage probability. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, existing interval prediction approaches are adopted in comparative experiments with 17 datasets extracted from five wind fields. The experimental results show that the proposed IT-2 FIPM achieves significant performance with huge promotion in the quality of the PI compared to the traditional forecasting models.","2019","2022-05-04 14:37:21","2022-05-16 14:57:18","","4934-4943","","9","15","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Objective We aim to provide empirical evidence that requirement engineers may perform better at the task of selecting FRs while optimizing and balancing NFRs using an alternative (automated) i* post-processed model, compared to the original i* model. Method We performed a controlled experiment, designed to compare the original i* graphical notation, with our post-processed i* visualizations based on Pareto efficiency (a tabular and a radar chart visualization). Our experiment consisted of solving different exercises of various complexity for selecting FRs while balancing NFR. We considered the efficiency (time spent to correctly answer exercises), and the effectiveness (regarding time: time spent to solve exercises, independent of correctness; and regarding correctness of the answer, independent of time). Results The efficiency analysis shows it is 3.51 times more likely to solve exercises correctly with our tabular and radar chart visualizations than with i*. Actually, i* was the most time-consuming (effectiveness regarding time), had a lower number of correct answers (effectiveness regarding correctness), and was affected by complexity. Visual or textual preference of the subjects had no effect on the score. Beginners took more time to solve exercises than experts if i* is used (no distinction if our Pareto-based visualizations are used). Conclusion For complex model instances, the Pareto front based tabular visualization results in more correct answers, compared to radar chart visualization. When we consider effectiveness regarding time, the i* graphical notation is the most time consuming visualization, independent of the complexity of the exercise. Finally, regarding efficiency, subjects consume less time when using radar chart visualization than tabular visualization, and even more so compared to the original i* graphical notation.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:39","2022-05-16 14:57:12","","68-84","","","106","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>http://repositori.uji.es/xmlui/bitstream/10234/178285/1/INFORMATION_AND_SOFTWARE_TECHNOLOGY.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The automatic classification of maintenance data has been investigated over the past few decades owing to its usefulness in construction and facility management. To utilize automated data classification in the maintenance field, a data classification model is implemented in this study based on the analysis of different mechanical maintenance data. The developed model involves four main steps: (a) data acquisition, (b) feature extraction, (c) feature selection, and (d) classification. During data acquisition, four types of dataset are collected from the benchmark Google datasets. The attributes of each dataset are further processed for classification. Principal component analysis and first-order and second-order statistical features are computed during the feature extraction process. To reduce the dimensions of the features for error-free classification, feature selection was performed. The hybridization of two algorithms, the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) and Spotted Hyena Optimization (SHO), tends to produce a new algorithm—i.e., a Spotted Hyena-based Whale Optimization Algorithm (SH-WOA), which is adopted for performing feature selection. The selected features are subjected to a deep learning algorithm called Recurrent Neural Network (RNN). To enhance the efficiency of conventional RNNs, the number of hidden neurons in an RNN is optimized using the developed SH-WOA. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed model is verified utilizing the entire dataset. Experimental results show that the developed model can effectively solve uncertain data classification, which minimizes the execution time and enhances efficiency.","2020","2022-05-03 16:13:12","2022-05-16 14:57:02","","2008","","11","8","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/11/2008/pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\R22XF6LW\Abidi et al. - 2020 - Automated Maintenance Data Classification Using Re.pdf","","excluded; not an application","machine learning; Industry 4.0; principal component analysis; data classification; predictive mechanical maintenance; Recurrent Neural Network; Spotted Hyena-based Whale Optimization Algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It has an effective general strategy for easy incorporation of domain information along with effective control on the randomness in the search process to balance the exploration and exploitation. Moreover, its effective parallel implementation is desired in the current age. Such a Generalized Parallel QIEA framework designed for the solution of Subset Selection Problems is presented here. The computational performance results demonstrate its effectiveness in the solution of different large-sized hard SSPs like the Difficult Knapsack Problem, the Quadratic Knapsack Problem and the Multiple Knapsack problem.

In this paper, an Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy C-Means (EQIE-FCM) algorithm is proposed for data clustering. In the EQIE-FCM, quantum computing concept is utilized in combination with the FCM algorithm to improve the clustering process by evolving the clustering parameters. The improvement in the clustering process leads to improvement in the quality of clustering results. To validate the quality of clustering results achieved by the proposed EQIE-FCM approach, its performance is compared with the other quantum-based fuzzy clustering approaches and also with other evolutionary clustering approaches. To evaluate the performance of these approaches, extensive experiments are being carried out on various benchmark datasets and on the protein database that comprises of four superfamilies. The results indicate that the proposed EQIE-FCM approach finds the optimal value of fitness function and the fuzzifier parameter for the reported datasets. In addition to this, the proposed EQIE-FCM approach also finds the optimal number of clusters and more accurate location of initial cluster centers for these benchmark datasets. Thus, it can be regarded as a more efficient approach for data clustering.","2019","2022-05-11 14:32:39","2022-05-16 18:52:04","","50347-50361","","","7","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/8600701/08606940.pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\5KVFXUM5\8606940.html; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\R58IGH8M\Bharill et al. - 2019 - A Generalized Enhanced Quantum Fuzzy Approach for .pdf","","excluded; not an application","quantum computing; Computer science; Clustering algorithms; Clustering; Qubit; evolutionary algorithm; Proteins; Information technology; Partitioning algorithms; bioinformatics; fuzzy set theory","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

To further improve the solutions, post-processing techniques are often used on the results of quantum optimization. One such recent approach is the Multi Qubit Correction (MQC) algorithm by Dorband. In this paper, we will discuss and analyze the strengths and weaknesses of this technique. Based on our discussion, we perform an experiment on (i) how pairing heuristics on the input of MQC can affect the results of a quantum optimizer and (ii) a comparison between MQC and the built-in optimization method that D-wave Systems offers. Among our results, we are able to show that the built-in post-processing rarely beats MQC in our tests. We hope that by using the ideas and insights presented in this paper, researchers and developers will be able to make a more informed decision on what kind of post-processing methods to use for their quantum optimization needs.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:25","2022-05-16 18:51:35","","222-233","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-34500-6_16","<p>http://arxiv.org/pdf/1905.13107</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Given this context, the present study developed a tool called ATIMO that uses the optimization algorithms NSGAII, SPEA2, and MOCell, to put agile teams together. The algorithms implemented in ATIMO were tested by being applied to four real projects in an experiment performed by a software development company. This approach took into account the project features, the developers’ profile, and both the project and the organization constraints. As a result, the algorithms returned solutions with the number of resources needed to carry out the project as well as the best qualified resources for the project with productivity and lower cost to meet the established deadline. The algorithms NSGAII, and SPEA2 presented similar results and behavior, as the MOCell algorithm presented a better performance in computational effort and required a larger population for its saturation.","2019","2022-05-04 12:38:42","2022-05-16 18:51:31","","111-127","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-36701-5_10","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The new method is based on the physics of domain walls in one-dimensional Ising spin chains. I find that these encodings and the encoding of arbitrary two variable interactions is possible with only two body Ising terms Following on from similar results for the ‘one hot’ method of encoding discrete variables (Hadfield et al 2019 Algorithms 12 34) I also demonstrate that it is possible to construct two body mixer terms which do not leave the logical subspace, an important consideration for optimising using the quantum alternating operator ansatz. I additionally discuss how, since the couplings in the domain wall encoding only need to be ferromagnetic and therefore could in principle be much stronger than anti-ferromagnetic couplers, application specific quantum annealers for discrete problems based on this construction may be beneficial. Finally, I compare embedding for synthetic scheduling and colouring problems with the domain wall and one hot encodings on two graphs which are relevant for quantum annealing, the chimera graph and the Pegasus graph. For every case I examine I find a similar or better performance from the domain wall encoding as compared to one hot, but this advantage is highly dependent on the structure of the problem. For encoding some problems, I find an advantage similar to the one found by embedding in a Pegasus graph compared to embedding in a chimera graph.","2019-08","2022-05-04 10:31:32","2022-05-16 18:51:19","2022-05-04 10:31:32","045004","","4","4","","Quantum Sci.

Because the size of the largest graphs DW can directly solve is quite small (usually around 45 vertices), we also consider decomposition algorithms intended for larger graphs and analyze their performance. For smaller graphs that fit DW, we provide formulations of the maximum clique problem as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, which is one of the two input types (together with the Ising model) acceptable by the machine, and compare several quantum implementations to current classical algorithms such as simulated annealing, Gurobi, and third-party clique finding heuristics. We further estimate the contributions of the quantum phase of the quantum annealer and the classical post-processing phase typically used to enhance each solution returned by DW. We demonstrate that on random graphs that fit DW, no quantum speedup can be observed compared with the classical algorithms. On the other hand, for instances specifically designed to fit well the DW qubit interconnection network, we observe substantial speed-ups in computing time over classical approaches.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:17","2022-05-16 18:51:15","","363-377","","3-4","91","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11265-018-1357-8.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Therefore, it is of great significance to extract the useful fault features and diagnose faults based on raw vibration signals. In this paper, a novel deep feature learning method based on the fused-stacked autoencoders (AEs) for planetary gear fault diagnosis was proposed. First, to improve the data learning ability and the robustness of feature extraction process of AE model, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) and the contractive autoencoder (CAE) were studied, respectively. Then, the quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) was used to optimize the specific location and key parameters of SAEs and CAEs in deep learning architecture, and multiple SAEs and multiple CAEs were stacked alternately to form a novel deep learning architecture, which gave the deep learning architecture better data learning ability and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can address the raw vibration signals of planetary gear. Compared with other deep learning architectures and shallow learning architecture, the proposed method has better diagnosis performance, and it is an effective method of deep feature learning and fault diagnosis.","2019-01","2022-05-11 15:42:32","2022-05-16 18:44:23","2022-05-11 15:42:32","4522","","23","12","","","","","","","","","","en","http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","","","","www.mdpi.com","","Number: 23 Publisher: Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","<p>Cited By :2</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/12/23/4522/pdf</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\NBX76F2T\Chen et al. - 2019 - A Novel Deep Feature Learning Method Based on the .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\AJT5PGWY\4522.html","","included","deep feature learning; fault diagnosis; planetary gear; the fused-stacked AEs","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This development is necessarily linked to several concerns: energy, economic, environmental, etc. The introduction of the techniques of artificial intelligence software in the control and decision is essential in research and in the development of tomorrow’s networks. This paper deals with multi-criteria optimization metaheuristics. These criteria are moving toward the economic/environmental dispatch that addresses the impact of the cost of production and the emission of toxic gases such as competing objectives. This requires some form of conflict resolution to reach a solution. That is why we need effective optimization algorithms. The firefly algorithm and bat algorithm are two recent metaheuristics inspired by nature. Both methods have been studied and adapted to solve our multi-objective optimization problem within the constraints. At the end of this work, the hybridization of the firefly algorithm and bat algorithm was proposed. The purpose of this hybridization is to combine the advantages of both methods and thus improve their performance. The effectiveness of this new method was demonstrated by applying it on different network tests of 6, 10, and 20 generators; testing with several power demands in accordance with constraints; and considering the variability of active transmission losses.","2019-12-01","2022-05-11 16:31:53","2022-05-16 18:23:47","2022-05-11 16:31:53","8547-8559","","12","31","","Neural Comput & Applic","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\98ZHRGPT\Gherbi et al. - 2019 - Hybridization of two metaheuristics for solving th.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Metaheuristics; Bat algorithm; Combined economic and emission dispatch; Firefly algorithm; Hybridization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this regard, this article proposes an economic load dispatch (ELD) in the existence of renewable wind technology for consuming less fossil fuel energy. For the stochastic scenery of wind speed, the Weibull probability density function (PDF) is used. To boost up the convergence swiftness and advance the simulation results, opposition-based learning (OBL) is integrated with the basic moth flame optimization (MFO) technique, which depends on the social dealings of the moth in nature. The performance of OMFO is evaluated through four cases and each case consists of three different load demands. The simulation results by these methods along with various other existing algorithms in the literature are presented to demonstrate the validity and usefulness of the proposed OMFO.","2019","2022-05-04 14:37:26","2022-05-16 18:22:57","","65-84","","4","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Quantum computer provides a new computing paradigm for ML. Although universal quantum computers are still in infancy, special‐purpose D‐Wave machine hopefully becomes the breaking point of commercialized quantum computing. The core principle, quantum annealing (QA), enables the quantum system to naturally evolve toward the low‐energy states. D‐Wave's quantum computer has developed some applications of quantum ML based on quantum‐assisted ML algorithms, quantum Boltzmann machine, etc. Additionally, working with CPUs, quantum processing units is likely to advance ML in a quantum‐inspired way. Thus, a new advanced computing architecture, quantum‐classical hybrid approach consisting of QA, classical computing, and brain‐inspired cognitive science, is required to explore its superiority to universal quantum algorithms and classical ML algorithms. It is important to explore hybrid quantum/classical approaches to overcome the defects of ML such as high dependence on training data, low robustness to the noises, and cognitive impairment. The new framework is expected to gradually form a highly effective, accurate, and adaptive intelligent computing architecture for the next generation of AI.","2019","2022-05-11 15:39:22","2022-05-16 16:19:38","","","","2","1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We investigate the empirical performance of quantum annealing to solve the Nurse Scheduling Problem (NSP) with hard constraints using the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealing device. NSP seeks the optimal assignment for a set of nurses to shifts under an accompanying set of constraints on schedule and personnel. After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.","2019","2022-05-04 10:49:22","2022-05-16 16:18:33","","12837","","1","9","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :24</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49172-3.pdf</p>; <p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-019-49172-3.pdf</p>","","","included","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this process, the belief space defined by the cultural algorithm was used to improve the standard EHO. EHO is motivated by herding behavior of the elephant groups. These behaviors are modeled into two operators including clan updating operator and separating operator. In EHOC, based on belief space, the separating operator is defined, which is able to create new local optimums in search space, to improve the algorithm search ability and to create an algorithm with an optimal exploration–exploitation balance. The CA, EHO, and EHOC algorithms are applied to eight mathematical optimization problems and four truss weight minimization problems, and to assess the performance of the proposed algorithm, the results are compared. The results clearly indicate that EHOC is capable of accelerating the convergence rate effectively and can develop better solutions compared to the CA and EHO. In addition, it can produce competitive results in comparison with other metaheuristic algorithms in the literature.","2019-07-01","2022-05-05 18:23:36","2022-05-16 16:17:31","2022-05-05 18:23:36","781-801","","3","35","","Engineering with Computers","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","<p>Cited By :18</p>; <p>Export Date: 5 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\VYYATB4F\Jafari et al. - 2019 - An efficient hybrid of elephant herding optimizati.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Hybrid metaheuristic algorithms; Elephant herding optimization; Cultural algorithm; Mathematical optimization problems; Truss weight minimization problems","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In real-world applications, an autonomous mobile robot is expected to operate at variable speed. It should slow down in vicinity of obstacles, whereas moving at high speed in open areas. A LIDAR-based local navigator algorithm integrated with a variable speed module is implemented for local navigation and obstacle avoidance. A variable speed navigation paradigm is developed in integration with the ACO algorithm to dynamically adapt its speed to the environment scenarios. In addition to the variable speed ACO based navigation, grid-based map representations are imposed for real-time autonomous robot navigation. Simulation and comparison studies demonstrate effectiveness of the proposed real-time variable-speed-based ACO approach of an autonomous mobile robot.","2019","2022-05-04 14:49:16","2022-05-16 16:15:10","","232-242","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-26369-0_22","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Under this ranking concept among fuzzy numbers, we plan to minimize the fuzzy makespan. An extensive numerical study on large-scale scheduling problems up to 100 jobs is conducted to assess the performance of the DPSO algorithm.

The optimization problem of the nonconvex economic dispatch includes several constraints such as valve-point loading effect, multiple fuel option, and prohibited operating zones. Each generating unit locally evaluates quantities used as bids in the auction mechanism. These units send their bids to their neighbors in a communication graph that supports the power system and which provides the required information flow. A consensus procedure is used to share the bids among the network agents and resolves the auction. As a result, the power distribution of generating units is updated and the generation cost is minimized. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by simulations on standard test systems.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:50","2022-05-16 22:24:23","","1124-1132","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :177</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, they have a limitation in common in that recognition errors are likely to be produced when background noise surrounds the spoken command, thereby creating potential dangers for the disabled if recognition errors exist in the control systems. In this paper, a hybrid noise suppression filter is proposed to interface with the commercial speech recognizers in order to enhance the recognition accuracy under variant noisy conditions. It intends to decrease the recognition errors when the commercial speech recognizers are working under a noisy environment. It is based on a sigmoid function which can effectively enhance noisy speech using simple computational operations, while a robust estimator based on an adaptive-network-based fuzzy inference system is used to determine the appropriate operational parameters for the sigmoid function in order to produce effective speech enhancement under variant noisy conditions. The proposed hybrid noise suppression filter has the following advantages for commercial speech recognizers: (i) it is not possible to tune the inbuilt parameters on the commercial speech recognizers in order to obtain better accuracy; (ii) existing noise suppression filters are too complicated to be implemented for real-time speech recognition; and (iii) existing sigmoid function based filters can operate only in a single-noisy condition, but not under varying noisy conditions. The performance of the hybrid noise suppression filter was evaluated by interfacing it with a commercial speech recognizer, commonly used in electronic products. Experimental results show that improvement in terms of recognition accuracy and computational time can be achieved by the hybrid noise suppression filter when the commercial recognizer is working under various noisy environments in factories.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:34","2022-05-16 22:23:45","","132-139","","","14","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :1</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>; <p>https://espace.curtin.edu.au/bitstream/20.500.11937/27237/2/198326.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The existing quantum genetic algorithm has some defects, that quantum encoding scheme is tend to reduce the stability, so that the algorithm is prone to premature convergence and falls into local minima. Therefore, the chain of multiple genes encoding scheme is used to extend in the multi-dimensional space for improving this algorithm. By function extremum and simulation of neural network weights optimization, according to the characteristics of qubits and the normalization condition, double and triple chain binding coding schemes are proposed. By experiments on multiple genes encoding scheme chain, the performance of the algorithm is tested.

Ensemble computing has been proven to be a very promising paradigm. The fundamental motivation behind designing such bio-inspired optimization models lies in the fact that interactions among different sole optimizers can afford much better income as compared with an individual optimizer. To do so, the authors propose an optimization technique called ensemble mutable smart bee algorithm (E-MSBA) which is based on the aggregation of several independent low-level optimizers. Here, each low-level unit of the proposed ensemble framework uses mutable smart bee algorithm (MSBA) for optimization procedure. The main provocations behind selecting MSBAs of different properties as components of ensemble are twofold. On the one hand, MSBA proved its capability for handling multimodal constraint problems. On the other hand, based on different experiments, it was demonstrated that MSBA can find the optimum solution with a relatively low computational cost. In this study, the authors intend to indicate that the proposed ensemble paradigm can efficiently optimize the operating parameters of a large scale power system which includes different mechanical components. To this end, E-MSBA and some rival methods are taken into account for the optimization procedure. The obtained results reveal that E-MSBA inherits some positive features of the MSBA algorithm. Additionally, it is observed that the ensembling approach enables the proposed method to effectively tackle the flaws associated with optimization of large scale problems.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:16","2022-05-16 22:17:42","","206-223","","2","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :20</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A common way to structure these systems is in terms of their interacting software components, whose composition and connections need to be properly adjusted. Its abstract and highly combinatorial nature increases the complexity of the problem. In this scenario, Search-based Software Engineering (SBSE) may serve to support this decision making process from initial analysis models, since the discovery of component-based architectures can be formulated as a challenging multiple optimisation problem, where different metrics and configurations can be applied depending on the design requirements and its specific domain. Many-objective optimisation evolutionary algorithms can provide an interesting alternative to classical multi-objective approaches. This paper presents a comparative study of five different algorithms, including an empirical analysis of their behaviour in terms of quality and variety of the returned solutions. Results are also discussed considering those aspects of concern to the expert in the decision making process, like the number and type of architectures found. The analysis of many-objectives algorithms constitutes an important challenge, since some of them have never been explored before in SBSE.","2014","2022-05-04 12:38:32","2022-05-16 22:17:23","","1287-1294","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

But future data such as wind power output and power load would not be accurately predicted and the nonlinear nature involved in the complex multiobjective scheduling model; therefore, to achieve accurate solution to such complex problem is a very difficult task. This paper presents an interval programming model with 2-step optimization algorithm to solve multiobjective dispatching. Initially, we represented the future data into interval numbers and simplified the object function to a linear programming problem to search the feasible and preliminary solutions to construct the Pareto set.

One key technology for implementing the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the proposed method. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1) facilitate real-time intelligent perception, and the collection of energy consumption and environmental impact data generated in the entire life cycle of manufacturing by using IoT technologies; and 2) realize effective data integration between the ESER evaluation system and the existing enterprise information systems based on BOM.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:51","2022-05-16 22:09:21","","1252-1261","","2","10","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :119</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Finding an optimal solution for these decision-making situations is a difficult task without some kind of automated support, as there are many possible alternative work allocation solutions and each solution affects the cost and duration of project differently. To assist project managers in these situations, we propose a tool for planning GSD projects.

In SSG-PSO, a collection of superior solutions is maintained and updated with the evolutionary process, such that each particle can comprehensively learn from the recorded superior solutions. In addition, to maintain the diversity of the particle swarm, SSG-PSO is combined with an individual level based mutation operator, which will be invoked when a particle is trapped in a local optimum (determined by the fitness and position states of the particle), thereby improving the adaptation and flexibility of each individual particle. Moreover, two gradient-based local search techniques, namely, the Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno (BFGS) and Davidon–Fletcher–Powell (DFP) Quasi–Newton methods, and two derivative-free local search techniques, namely, pattern search and Nelder–Mead simplex search, are incorporated into SSG-PSO.

In order to rank the non-dominated solutions obtained to select the best guider of the particle, three different ranking methods, i.e. the random ranking, an entropy-based density ranking, and a fuzzy cardinal priority ranking are investigated in the paper. Experimental results show that MOJPSO is more flexible and effective for exploring the search space to find more non-dominated solutions in the Pareto Front.

And then, based on the probability distribution of wind speed and solar radiation intensity as well as the copula join function, the joint probability distribution of maximum available output of multiple solar and wind farms is built. The economic dispatch model for multi-energy complementary system considering the TGC was proposed to maximize renewable energy utilization. This model aims at minimizing total system cost whist fulfilling the constraints of power system stable operation and hot/cold water pipes safe operation. After that, in order to address the non-convex scheduling optimization problem, global descent method is applied, which can continuously update the local optimal solutions by global descent function, and find global optimal solution.

The total cost of the whole shell-and-tube heat exchanger is set as the objective function, including the investment cost for initial manufacture and the operational cost involving the power consumption to overcome the frictional pressure loss.

However meta-heuristic methods, have the disadvantage of convergence time, which is due to the high number of agents and iterations. To solve this problem we have combined two meta-heuristic methods, the GA and the PSO with a classical method SQP. The proposed hybrid method performs the first step with a global search using the method of PSO on the best 10 % among the members of the population of the genetic algorithm. On the other hand, other operators of GA are applied to the remaining 90 % of the population. In the second step, a conventional method (SQP) is applied, to give a final value with high precision and accuracy. Since the work is done step by step around the approximate solution, the proposed approach is applied for solving a multi-objective problem in order to achieve the set of optimal solutions and best compromising solution between the cost function and emission function. In this work, this technique is used on a power network, in which wind energy was injected. To validate the robustness of the proposed approach, the proposed algorithm is tested on the norme IEEE 30-bus and on the Algerian 59-bus electrical network. Comparison of the results with recent global optimization methods show the superiority of the proposed approach and confirm its potential for solving practical optimal power flow in terms of solution quality and convergence characteristics.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:22","2022-05-16 22:06:00","","577-590","","4","5","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :7</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Meanwhile, the renewable energy such as wind energy is an important approach to reduce pollution emissions, as well as the dependence on fossil fuels. In this paper, a newly developed optimization technique, called Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithm based on Decomposition (MOEA/D), has been applied to optimize the cost and emission of wind–thermal power system. MOEA/D provides a simple but efficient framework which decomposes a Multi-objective Optimization Problem (MOP) into a number of scalar optimization subproblems and optimizes them simultaneously. The stochastic nature of wind power is modeled by Weibull probability distribution function and the uncertainty of wind power is considered as system constraints with stochastic variables. To validate the effectiveness of the MOEA/D method, it is first applied to solve the traditional EED problem of standard IEEE 30-bus 6-generator system as the benchmark. Then, the effect of wind power penetration on cost and emission is analyzed by MOEA/D in a 6-generator system and a 40-generator system with wind farms based on the proposed EED model. A comparative analysis with other similar optimization methods reveals that the MOEA/D method is able to generate better performance in terms of both solution quality and computational efficiency.","2014","2022-05-04 14:36:41","2022-05-16 22:04:56","","434-445","","","63","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :80</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In fuzzy based clustering algorithms, the procedure acquired for choosing the fuzziness parameter $m$, the number of clusters $C$ and the initial cluster centroids <sub>C</sub> is extremely important as it has a direct impact on the formation of final clusters. Moreover, the improper selection of these parameters may lead the algorithms to the local optima. In this paper, we proposed an Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy C-Means (EQIE-FCM) algorithm to compute the global optimal value of these parameters. In EQIE-FCM, we utilize the quantum computing concept in combination with fuzzy clustering to evolve the different values of these parameters in several generations. However, in each generation these parameters are represented in terms of a quantum bit $(Q)$. At each generation $(g)$, the quantum bit of these parameters is updated using a quantum rotational gate. Through this, after several generations of evolution, we get the global optimal values of these parameters from a large quantum search space. The EQIE-FCM algorithm is applied on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and the performance of EQIE-FCM is compared with another Quantum-inspired Fuzzy Clustering (QIE-FCM) and other three fuzzy based evolutionary clustering algorithms from the literature. Extensive experiments indicate that the EQIE-FCM algorithm outperforms many baseline approaches and can be used an effective clustering algorithm.","2015","2022-05-11 14:32:39","2022-05-16 22:02:47","","772-779","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Cited By :5</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\6CSVDIKC\Bharill et al. - 2015 - An Enhanced Quantum-Inspired Evolutionary Fuzzy Cl.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Computer science; Clustering algorithms; Quantum computing; Algorithm design and analysis; Partitioning algorithms; Diabetes; Insulin","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a new multi-objective particle swarm optimization algorithm based on decomposition (MPSO/D) is proposed. Firstly, the objective space of a multi-objective problem is decomposed into a set of sub-regions based on a set of direction vectors. Then MPSO/D makes each sub-region have a solution to maintain the diversity. Secondly, considering the convergence of solutions, MPSO/D uses the crowding distance to calculate the fitness values of the reserved solutions for selection operator, and uses the neighboring particles of a particle to determine the global best historical position (gbest) of the particle. The proposed algorithm has been compared with NSGAII, MOEA/D and NNIA on sixteen test sets. The experimental results illustrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms NSGAII, MOEA/D and NNIA in terms of convergence and diversity.","2015-12-20","2022-05-04 15:03:07","2022-05-16 22:00:58","2022-05-04 15:03:07","541-557","","","325","","Information Sciences","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","<p>Cited By :103</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\A9FR8FP8\Dai et al. - 2015 - A new multi-objective particle swarm optimization .pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\PDGZX8DU\S0020025515005101.html","","excluded; not an application","Artificial intelligence; Particle swarm optimization; Crowding distance; Decomposition; Multi-objective optimization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However, even with sophisticated techniques, a dilemma arises from all these models, called the random walk dilemma (RWD). In this context, the concept of time phase adjustment was proposed to overcome such dilemma for daily frequency financial time series. However, the evolution of trading platforms had increased the frequency for performing operations on the stock market to fractions of seconds, which makes needed the analysis of high-frequency financial time series. In this way, this work presents a model, called the increasing decreasing linear neuron (IDLN), for high-frequency stock market forecasting. Also, a descending gradient-based method with automatic time phase adjustment is presented for the proposed model design. Besides, an experimental analysis is conduced using a set of high-frequency financial time series from the Brazilian stock market, and the achieved results overcame those obtained by establishing forecasting models in the literature.","2015","2022-05-04 14:58:59","2022-05-16 22:00:54","","4081-4096","","8","42","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :27</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Large integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) in modern power system makes generation planning more complex. This paper presents the individual and collective impact of three distributed energy resources (DERs), namely, wind power generator as a renewable energy source, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) and emergency demand response program (EDRP) on unit commitment. In this paper, an inconsistent nature of wind speed and wind power is characterized by the Weibull probability distribution function considering overestimation and underestimation cost model of the stochastic wind power. The extensive economic analysis of UC with DERs is carried out to attain the least total cost of the entire system. To obtain the optimum solution, Teaching–learning based optimization (TLBO) algorithm is employed to solve the unit commitment problem considering IEEE standard 10 unit test system in this study. It is found that the combined effect of wind power generator, plug-in electric vehicles and emergency demand response program on UC significantly lessen the total cost of the system.","2015","2022-05-04 14:36:26","2022-05-16 22:00:37","","1-14","","","71","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :19</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

On the other hand, while using wind power decreases the overall power generation cost for the power grid, it poses a risk to a traditional grid, because of its inherent stochastic characteristics. Therefore, an economic dispatch optimization model needs to consider all of the fuel cost, emissions control cost and wind power cost for each of the generating unit conforming the fleet that meets the required grid power demand. In this study, an optimization algorithm referred as diffusion particle optimization (DPO) is proposed to solve such complex optimization problem. In this algorithm, Brownian motion theory is used to guide the movement of particles so that the particles can search for an optimal solution over the entire definition region. Several benchmark functions and power grid system data were used to test the performance of DPO, and compared to traditional algorithms used for economic dispatch optimization, such as, particle swarm optimization and artificial bee colony algorithm. It was found that DPO has less probability to be trapped in local optimums. According to results of different power systems DPO was able to find economic dispatch solutions with lower costs. DPO was also used to analyze the impact of wind power risk and fossil unit emissions coefficients on power dispatch. The result are encouraging for the use of DPO as a dynamic tool for economic dispatch of the power grid.","2015","2022-05-04 14:36:23","2022-05-16 22:00:29","","1251-1260","","","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :33</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The stochastic nature of wind power and the uncertainties in the EV owner’s behavior are suitably modelled by statistical models available in recent literatures. The offshore wind farms are assumed to be composed of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) having reactive power control capability and are connected to offshore grid by HVDC link. In order to obtain the optimal active power schedules of different energy sources, an optimization problem is solved by applying recently introduced Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC). The accuracy of proposed approach has been tested by implementing AC–DC optimal power flow on modified IEEE 5-bus, IEEE 9-bus, and IEEE 39-bus systems. The results obtained by GABC algorithm are compared with the results available in literatures. This paper also includes AC–DC optimal power flow model, implemented on modified IEEE-30 bus test system by including wind farm power and V2G source. It has been shown that the uncertainty associated with availability of power from wind farm and PEVs affects the overall cost of operation of system.","2015","2022-05-04 14:36:33","2022-05-16 21:58:40","","173-187","","","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :27</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper explores an alternate approach of sampling. This approach is called SWAY (Samplying WAY) and finds the (near) optimal solutions to the problem by (i) creating a larger initial population and (ii) intelligently sampling the solution space to find the best subspace. Unlike evolutionary algorithms, SWAY does not use mutation or cross-over or multi-generational reasoning to find interesting subspaces but relies on the underlying dimensions of the solution space. Experiments with Software Engineering (SE) models shows that SWAY’s performance improvement is competitive with standard MOEAs while, terminating over an order of magnitude faster.","2016","2022-05-04 12:38:36","2022-05-16 21:14:18","","96-111","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-47106-8_7","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The order of test cases is determined by prioritization objectives such as covering code or critical components as rapidly as possible. The importance of this technique has been recognized in the context of Highly-Configurable Systems (HCSs), where the potentially huge number of configurations makes testing extremely challenging. However, current approaches for test case prioritization in HCSs suffer from two main limitations. First, the prioritization is usually driven by a single objective which neglects the potential benefits of combining multiple criteria to guide the detection of faults. Second, instead of using industry-strength case studies, evaluations are conducted using synthetic data, which provides no information about the effectiveness of different prioritization objectives. In this paper, we address both limitations by studying 63 combinations of up to three prioritization objectives in accelerating the detection of faults in the Drupal framework. Results show that non–functional properties such as the number of changes in the features are more effective than functional metrics extracted from the configuration model. Results also suggest that multi-objective prioritization typically results in faster fault detection than mono-objective prioritization.","2016","2022-05-04 12:38:34","2022-05-16 21:13:50","","287-310","","","122","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>https://idus.us.es/bitstream/11441/60653/1/MultiObj-TestCase-Prio.pdf</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

A common way to structure such complex systems is in terms of their interacting software components, whose composition and connections need to be properly adjusted. Along with the expected functionality, non-functional requirements are key at this stage to guide the many design alternatives to be evaluated by software architects. The appearance of Search Based Software Engineering (SBSE) brings an approach that supports the software engineer along the design process. Evolutionary algorithms can be applied to deal with the abstract and highly combinatorial optimisation problem of architecture discovery from a multiple objective perspective. The definition and resolution of many-objective optimisation problems is currently becoming an emerging challenge in SBSE, where the application of sophisticated techniques within the evolutionary computation field needs to be considered. In this paper, diverse non-functional requirements are selected to guide the evolutionary search, leading to the definition of several optimisation problems with up to 9 metrics concerning the architectural maintainability. An empirical study of the behaviour of 8 multi- and many-objective evolutionary algorithms is presented, where the quality and type of the returned solutions are analysed and discussed from the perspective of both the evolutionary performance and those aspects of interest to the expert. Results show how some many-objective evolutionary algorithms provide useful mechanisms to effectively explore design alternatives on highly dimensional objective spaces.","2016","2022-05-04 12:38:31","2022-05-16 21:13:08","","2546-2600","","6","21","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a novel fuzzy document-based information retrieval scheme (FDIRS) is proposed for the purpose of Stock Market Index forecasting. The novelty of the proposed approach is the use of a modified tf-idf scoring scheme to predict the future trend of the stock market index. The contribution of this paper has two dimensions: (1) In the proposed system, the simple daily time series data are converted to an enriched fuzzy linguistic time series with a unique approach of incorporating information about the manner in which the OHLC (open, high, low, and close) price formation took place at every instance of the time series, and (2) A unique approach is followed while modeling the information retrieval (IR) system which converts a simple IR system into a forecasting system. The modified IR system provides us with a trend forecast and after which a crisp value is generated that becomes the forecast value that can be achieved in next few trading sessions.

This paper proposes an approach to generate dynamic moving average trading rules in crude oil futures markets. An adaptive moving average calculation is used to better describe the fluctuations, and trading rules can be adjusted dynamically in the investment period based on the performance of four reference rules. We use genetic algorithms to select optimal dynamic moving average trading rules from a large set of possible parameters. Our results indicate that dynamic trading rules can help traders make profit in the crude oil futures market and are more effective than the BH strategy in the price decrease process. Moreover, dynamic moving average trading rules are more favorable to traders than static trading rules, and the advantage becomes more obvious over long investment cycles. The lengths of the two periods of dynamic moving average trading rules are closely associated with price volatility. The dynamic trading rules will have outstanding performance when market is shocked by significant energy related events. Investment advices are given out and these advices are helpful for traders when choosing technical trading rules in actual investments.","2016","2022-05-04 14:58:51","2022-05-16 21:08:11","","1608-1618","","","162","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :19</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.","2016-06-01","2022-05-05 18:26:15","2022-05-16 21:07:44","2022-05-05 18:26:15","210-228","","2","25","","J.

Wind generators participating in electricity markets will encounter operational risk (i.e. imbalance cost) under current trading mechanism. The imbalance cost arises from the service for mitigating supply-demand imbalance caused by inaccurate wind forecasts. In this paper, an insurance strategy is proposed to cover the possible imbalance cost that wind power producers may incur. First of all, a novel method based on Monte Carlo simulations is proposed to estimate insurance premiums. The impacts of insurance excesses on premiums are analyzed as well. Energy storage system (ESS) is then discussed as an alternative approach to balancing small wind power forecasting errors, whose loss claims would be blocked by insurance excesses. Finally, the ESS and insurance policy are combined together to mitigate the imbalance risks of trading wind power in real-time markets. With the proposed approach, the most economic power capacity of ESS can be determined under different excess scenarios. Case studies prove that the proposed ESS plus insurance strategy is a promising risk aversion approach for trading wind power in real-time electricity markets.","2016","2022-05-04 14:36:20","2022-05-16 21:05:36","","606-615","","","89","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :19</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Over the last few decades, a large number of solution approaches, including evolutionary algorithms, have been developed to solve this problem. However, these approaches are usually ineffective and time consuming. In this paper, we apply two variants of genetic algorithm (GA) for solving the problem where the first variant is to optimize the allocation and the second one is to rank the generators for allocation. The proposed algorithm is applied to a recent wind-thermal benchmark that comprises five thermal and 160 wind farms. The model includes a stochastic nature of wind energy and gas emission effects of thermal plants. The simulation results show that the proposed method is superior to those results of different variants of GA and the state-of-the-art algorithms.","2016","2022-05-04 12:23:48","2022-05-16 21:03:10","","258-269","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-28270-1_22","<p>Cited By :4</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this study, we propose a neuron model based on dendritic mechanisms and a phase space reconstruction (PSR) to analyze the Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index, Deutscher Aktienindex, N225, and DJI Average. The PSR allows us to reconstruct the financial time series, so we can prove that attractors exist for the systems constructed. Thus, the attractors obtained can be observed intuitively in a three-dimensional search space, thereby allowing us to analyze the characteristics of dynamic systems. In addition, using the reconstructed phase space, we confirmed the chaotic properties and the reciprocal to determine the limit of prediction through the maximum Lyapunov exponent. We also made short-term predictions based on the nonlinear approximating dendritic neuron model, where the experimental results showed that the proposed methodology which hybridizes PSR and the dendritic model performed better than traditional multi-layered perceptron, the Elman neural network, the single multiplicative neuron model and the neuro-fuzzy inference system in terms of prediction accuracy and training time. Hopefully, this hybrid technology is capable to advance the research for financial time series and provide an effective solution to risk management.","2016","2022-05-04 14:58:58","2022-05-16 21:02:17","","214-224","","","105","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :114</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Besides, the categorization of the optimization problems has been presented in terms of the number of constraints, the structure of the variables, and linearity of the formulation elements. Considering the most familiar type of optimization problem, linear optimization approach has been examined in details. Then, some remarkable optimization techniques under the classification of unconstrained and constrained techniques have been investigated. Moreover, as regarding the increasing trend in the utilization of intelligent constrained optimization methods for the implementation and operational problems of renewable energy technologies, the literature have been reviewed.","2017","2022-05-04 14:37:06","2022-05-16 20:59:36","","27-74","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1016/b978-0-08-101041-9.00002-8","","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The proposed model has been used in a multiobjective optimization environment in which the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling and workload assignment have been efficiently optimized.","2017","2022-05-04 12:38:36","2022-05-16 20:54:45","","1249-1256","","3","13","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Managers decide to reduce the technical debt by planning one or more iterations for bug fixing. The time required to fix a bug depends on the required skill and the resource skill level. Managers seek to achieve fixing the highest number of bugs during the iteration while at the same time fixing the highest possible number of high severity and high priority bugs. In this study, we optimize the human resource assignment to achieve the objectives above, using multi-objective evolutionary algorithms, and then we add a fourth objective, i.e. that the bugs left out of the iteration should require the least time to finish.

Also, Quantum-behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO) for tuning the ANFIS membership functions has been used.

The specific fuel consumption (SFC) of each diesel engine changes nonlinearly with respect to its power product. Hence, this paper presents an economic fuel dispatch model for diesel engines powered oil rig platforms using the cubic spline interpolation curve fitting of the SFC-power non-linear dependence. Moreover, the total fuel consumption of the diesel generators significantly reduces by shifting a partial part of the electricity demand of the offshore drilling rigs from on-peak time intervals to off-peak periods. In addition, battery energy storage contributes to the load curve smoothing strategy. A mixed-integer non-linear programming problem is developed under generalized algebraic mathematical modeling system to find the optimum fuel consumption and power generation schedules of the diesel producers, the value of demand increase/decrease, and the charge/discharge pattern of the battery at each operating time interval. A benchmark oil rig with eight diesel engines and four tidal turbines is considered to validate the proposed methodology. Four cases are studied without and with application of battery and load shifting program. It is found that implementation of peak-clipping and valley filling to energy demand pattern and battery integration with tidal-diesel driven oil rigs cause a significant fuel saving. In the presence of battery, 70 g fuel saving is achieved over a 24-hours study horizon. Moreover, the implementation of time-based load shifting program with the capability of 30% load decreasing (at peak hours) and increasing (at off-peak periods) makes it possible to save 282 g diesel fuel according to the base electrical demand profile. Finally, simultaneous integration of battery and demand-side management programs (with maximum 10% load flexibility) causes 216 g fuel saving in sample operation day.","2021","2022-05-03 15:58:02","2022-06-28 12:55:49","2022-05-03 15:58:02","e12993","","9","31","","","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Wiley Online Library","","_eprint: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/2050-7038.12993","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\65M3GT96\Jabari et al. - 2021 - Optimization of a tidal-battery-diesel driven ener.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\NWIZZUNF\2050-7038.html","","excluded; not an application","diesel engine; battery storage; load shifting strategy; oil rig; tidal turbines farm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We focus on the use of that hardware to solve discrete hydrologic inverse problems, which can become computationally intense at even moderate sizes. In particular, we interrogate whether contemporary quantum annealers with more qubits, lower noise, and reverse annealing features can improve performance. We find modest improvements in speed and accuracy are possible; however, those benefits are currently constrained to a regime of very rapid, approximate solutions on small meshes.

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the ‘development cost’ is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.","2021-04-01","2022-05-04 11:21:21","2022-05-18 11:46:00","2022-05-04 11:21:20","107154","","","154","","Computers & Industrial Engineering","","","","","","","","en","","","","","ScienceDirect","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\ISRLT4XK\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf","","included","Sustainable production; Imperfect production system; Interval number; Inventory model; Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Multilevel thresholding image segmentation is one of the effective techniques for image segmentation. The computation time grows exponentially of traditional multilevel thresholding methods such as Kapur with the number of thresholds. Meta-heuristic algorithms based on swarm intelligence have proved their efficiency in solving the multilevel thresholding optimization problem. In this paper, a new hybrid algorithm based on quantum computing (QC) and optimal foraging algorithm (OFA) for multilevel image segmentation is presented. The main characteristic of the proposed quantum optimal foraging algorithm (QOFA) is the integration of quantum operators such as interference with the optimization process of OFA to get a proper balance between exploration and exploitation phases. The feasibility of the proposed multilevel image segmentation algorithm has been evaluated and tested on real abdominal CT liver images. All the results are analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively to evaluate the effectiveness and the robustness of the proposed algorithm. The experimental results revealed that the proposed algorithm is a very promising algorithm and it can provide better segmentation results compared with the standard OFA.","2021","2022-05-03 16:13:17","2022-05-18 11:45:23","","1-45","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\K2G4ZACF\Sayed - 2021 - A novel multilevel thresholding algorithm based on.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Global optimization; Quantum mechanics; CT images; Multilevel thresholding; Optimal foraging algorithm","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The precise modeling of reaction wheels is of fundamental need in spacecraft ACS for design, analysis, simulation, and fault diagnosis applications. The complex nature of the reaction wheel leads to modeling difficulties utilizing the conventional modeling schemes. Additionally, the absence of reaction wheel providers’ parameters is crucial for triggering a new modeling scheme. The Radial Basis Function Neural Network (RBFNN) has an efficient architecture, alluring generalization properties, invulnerability against noise, and amazing training capabilities. This research proposes a promising modeling scheme for the spacecraft reaction wheel utilizing RBFNN and an improved variant of the Quantum Behaved Particle Swarm Optimization (QPSO). The problem of enhancing the network parameters of the RBFNN at the training phase is formed as a nonlinear constrained optimization problem. Thus, it is proposed to efficiently resolve utilizing an enhanced version of QPSO with mutation strategy (EQPSO-2M). The proposed technique is compared with the conventional QPSO algorithm and different variants of PSO algorithms. Evaluation criteria rely upon convergence speed, mean best fitness value, stability, and the number of successful runs that has been utilized to assess the proposed approach. A non-parametric test is utilized to decide the critical contrast between the results of the proposed algorithm compared with different algorithms. The simulation results demonstrated that the training of the proposed RBFNN-based reaction wheel model with enhanced parameters by EQPSO-2M algorithm furnishes a superior prediction accuracy went with effective network architecture.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:19","2022-05-18 11:36:42","","4","","1","69","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Export Date: 11 May 2022</p>; <p>https://jeas.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s44147-021-00056-2</p>; <p>https://jeas.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s44147-021-00056-2</p>","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\CCE9P454\Abd-Elhay et al. - 2022 - A high accuracy modeling scheme for dynamic system.pdf; C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\DAWTDSVW\s44147-021-00056-2.html","","excluded; not an application","PSO; Quantum Particle Swarm Optimization; Attitude control subsystem; RBFNN; Reaction wheel model","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

It is needed to ensure that the modifications have not produced any errors or faults, thereby maintaining the quality and reliability of the software. The testers usually avoid exhaustive retesting because it requires lots of effort and time. The test case prioritization and minimization solve the issue by scheduling the critical test cases and removing redundant ones. Optimization techniques help by improving the efficiency of these techniques while utilizing limited resources. This paper proposed an enhanced discrete novel bat algorithm for the test case prioritization. The algorithm is modified in two ways. First, we have proposed a fix-up mechanism for the discrete combinatorial problem, which conducts the perturbation in the population using the asexual reproduction algorithm. Second, the novel bat algorithm is improved, where the bats hunt in different habitats with quantum behavior using Gaussian distribution and search in the limited habitat with Doppler effect. In addition, we have embedded the test case minimization procedure in the algorithm for redundancy reduction. The experimental results are empirically analyzed using different testing criteria, i.e., fault and statement coverage on three subject programs from the software infrastructure repository. Consequently, test selection percentage, coverage loss, fault detection loss, and cost reduction percentages are deduced for the test case minimization at program and version levels. Empirical results and statistical comparisons with the random search, bat algorithm, novel bat algorithm, birds swarm algorithm, whale optimization algorithm, and genetic algorithm show the outperformance of the proposed algorithm.","2022-05-06","2022-05-11 16:29:15","2022-05-18 11:34:29","2022-05-11 16:29:15","","","","","","Soft Comput","","","","","","","","en","","","","","Springer Link","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\3RWAWGF3\Bajaj et al. - 2022 - Improved novel bat algorithm for test case priorit.pdf","","excluded; not an application","Bat algorithm; Nature-inspired algorithms; Regression testing; Search-based software testing; Test case minimization; Test case prioritization","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The well-designed machine learning based controller translates the knowledge of global optimization to real-time controlling scheme with the consideration of adaptabilities to disperse driving conditions. To start with, the universal global optimal control policies for varying driving environment are generated offline based on the chaotic quantum particle swarm optimization with sequential quadratic programming (CQPSO-SQP). Then, the offline optimized global control policies are assembled to construct the dataset for training the least square support vector machine (LSSVM) based controller, which features the superior capability in instantly optimal policy making under different driving conditions. At last, the detailed assessment is performed in simulation test and hardware-in-loop (HIL) test to validate the promising role of CQPSO-PSO and LSSVM in designing the novel energy management controller, and the corresponding results highlight the preferable controlling performance of the proposed novel controller in practical applications.","2022","2022-05-03 16:13:19","2022-05-18 11:02:53","","130250","","","334","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","C:\Users\Work\Zotero\storage\D5UUVD4P\Liu et al. - 2022 - A novel data-driven controller for plug-in hybrid .pdf","","excluded; not an application","Quantum particle swarm optimization; Sequential quadratic programming; Chaotic optimization; Least square support vector machine.; Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Hence, in this paper, imperialist competitive algorithm (ICA) is proposed to solve such complicated problem. The feasibility of the proposed method is validated on five and ten units test system for a 24 h time interval. The results obtained by the ICA are compared with other techniques of the literature. These results substantiate the applicability of the proposed method for solving the constrained DED with non-smooth cost functions.

These functions can be used to calculate output-overestimate and output-underestimate probabilities in each interval, so possible extra costs for maintaining the power system stability caused by incorporating unstable wind power can be calculated. Taking into account the possible costs, a stochastic optimization model for dynamic economic dispatch of wind-thermal power system is established to minimize the comprehensive operation expected cost. Moreover, a new algorithm, bi-population chaotic differential evolution (BPCDE) algorithm is proposed to solve this complicated model. The algorithm introduces bi-population evolution strategy, chaotic map update mechanism and Metropolis rule to improve the standard differential evolution algorithm. These improvements can overcome the premature problem caused by lacking of the individual diversity in the later stage of differential evolution and strengthen the global search ability of the algorithm.

Determining the power generation output of units at minimum total fuel cost a dynamic environment with ramp rate limits to satisfy load demand and transmission losses is too complicated and has a lot of local optima in its search space. In addition, the proposed problem has a non-linear, non-convex, non-smooth, multi-modal, non-separable, and non-differentiable nature. In order to overcome above problems a new hybrid technique, based on bacterial foraging and simplified swarm optimization algorithms combined with a new mutation operator and opposition-based initialization is proposed to restraint the premature convergence of the solutions. Therefore, the bacteria in chemo-tactic procedure are moved in short or long steps as well as swimming movements. Furthermore, to increase the diversity of the solution of the search space a novel self-adaptive mutation strategy which profits from four mutation rules is implemented. For more validation the simulation results are applied on four small, medium and large scale systems with 5-unit, 10-unit, 30-unit and 100-unit and compared with those of other methods in the area.","2013","2022-05-04 12:24:43","2022-05-16 22:33:54","","414-429","","","49","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :59</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

However it has been proven as an NP-hard problem to find minimum attribute reduction. It is therefore necessary to investigate efficient heuristic algorithms to find near-optimal solutions. In this paper, a novel and efficient minimum attribute reduction algorithm based on quantum-inspired self-adaptive cooperative co-evolution incorporated into shuffled frog leaping algorithm is proposed. First, evolutionary frog individuals are represented by multi-state quantum bits, and self-adaptive quantum rotation angle and quantum mutation probability strategy are adopted to update the operation of quantum revolving door. Second, a self-adaptive cooperative co-evolutionary model for minimum attribute reduction is designed to divide the evolutionary attribute sets into reasonable subsets. The subsets are assigned the self-adaptive mechanism according to their historical performance records, and each of them is evolved by the quantum-inspired shuffled frog leaping algorithm. So the reasonable decompositions are more easily produced by exploiting any correlation and interdependency between attribute subsets interaction. Finally, global convergence of the proposed algorithm is proved in theory, and its performance is investigated on some global optimization functions, UCI datasets and magnetic resonance images (MRIs), compared with existing state-of-the-art algorithms. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm can achieve a higher performance on the convergence rate and stability of attribute reduction. So it can be considered as a more competitive heuristic algorithm on the efficiency and accuracy of minimum attribute reduction.","2013","2022-05-04 12:41:49","2022-05-16 22:31:53","","1-13","","","50","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :16</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In this paper, a new correlated bivariate Weibull probability distribution model is proposed to analytically remove the assumption that the total WP is characterized by a single random variable. This probability distribution is used as chance constraint. The inclusion of the probability distribution of stochastic WP in the EED problem is defined as the here-and-now strategy. Non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm built in MATLAB is used to handle the EED problem as a multi-objective optimization problem.

The evolution in TLPSO-IDL is performed sequentially on both the current swarm and the memory swarm. A new learning mechanism is proposed in the former to enhance the swarm's exploration capability, whilst an intelligent division of labor (IDL) module is developed in the latter to adaptively divide the swarm into the exploration and exploitation sections. The proposed TLPSO-IDOL algorithm is thoroughly compared with nine well-establish PSO variants on 16 unimodal and multimodal benchmark problems with or without rotation property.

The migration operation inspired from biogeography-based optimization (BBO) algorithm is newly introduced in the proposed approach, thereby effectively exploring and exploiting promising regions in a space search by creating dynamically new efficient partitions. This new mechanism based migration between individuals from different subsystems makes the initial partitions to react more by changing experiences.

A multicast communication creates a distribution tree structure, on which a multicast source sends a single copy of data to a group of receivers. QoS multicast routing is a non-linear combinatorial optimization problem which has been proved to be NP-complete, in which we try to find a multicast tree with minimized cost that satisfies multiple constraints. In this paper, we propose a tree based Chemical Reaction Optimization (CRO) Algorithm to solve QoS multicast routing problem. CRO mimics trees as molecules in a chemical reaction, and performs collision between molecules and based on potential energy, we select optimal result. Reckoning results for various random generated networks show that the proposed algorithm outperforms other existing heuristics.","2013","2022-05-04 12:34:35","2022-05-16 22:25:29","","68-77","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-03753-0_7","","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The CHP economic dispatch is solved in two levels known as the lower level and higher level. The higher level is the optimization of the surrogate dual function for the relaxed global constraints in which the surrogate subgradient is used to update the Lagrangian multipliers. Coherently, the lower levels are the optimization of the subproblems taking in count each of its local constraints. Flexibility for the choice of algorithm is given at the lower levels optimization techniques with the condition that the algorithm is able to improve its search at each iteration. It is also seen that simple step size rules such as the ‘square summable but not summable’ and ‘constant step size’ could be used easily and leads the method to convergence. In addition this paper illustrates the ear clipping method used to modify the common nonconvex feasible region of CHP benchmark problems to a convex region which subsequently enhances the search for an optimal solution. The algorithm is then justified through a numerical test on three benchmark CHP problem with a nonconvex feasible region. Results prove that the algorithm is reliable and could be easily implemented even on a much complex and nonconvex problems.","2013","2022-05-04 12:25:12","2022-05-16 22:25:18","","421-430","","1","44","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :109</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not an application","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

We employ a combination of static and evolutionary learning of model structure, in addition to utilizing a pre-computed solution used as a “seed” in the midst of a randomly-generated initial population. The seed solution works like a single straw that is enough to break the camel's back-given that it is a feature-rich seed.

The CEED problem aims to minimize the scheduling cost and greenhouse gases (GHGs) emission cost. Here the GHGs include carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulphur oxides (SOx). A dispatch model including both thermal generators and wind farms is developed. The probability of stochastic wind power based on the Weibull distribution is included in the CEED model. The model is tested on a standard system involving six thermal units and two wind farms. A set of numerical case studies are reported.

Along with China's rapid development of wind power in recent years, the issue of how to integrate more wind power to the grid, and how to balance the conflict between pollutant and GHG emission reduction and economic cost increase by dispatch model adjustment becomes a big challenge. Based on the GAMS simulation method, by using the real data of thermal power units, wind power and hydropower generation, and load in Liaoning province, this paper studies a joint environmental and economic power dispatch considering wind power integration at valley load and peak load. The results show that the pumped storage power station played an important role in promoting wind power integration. And the power dispatch across thermal power, wind power and hydropower is more favorable than the power dispatch only across thermal power and wind power in terms of reducing pollutant and GHG emission. It is also proved that a comparatively better environmental improvement can be made at a relatively lower economic loss by a joint environmental and economic dispatch across thermal, wind and hydropower.","2013","2022-05-04 12:24:37","2022-05-16 22:24:42","","260-265","","","52","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<p>Cited By :31</p>; <p>Export Date: 4 May 2022</p>","","","excluded; not a primary study","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
