It was only recently that small but functional quantum computers have become available on the cloud, allowing to test their potential. In this paper we propose to leverage their capabilities to address an important task for recommender systems providers, the optimal selection of recommendation carousels. In many video-on-demand and music streaming services the user is provided with a homepage containing several recommendation lists, i.e., carousels, each built with a certain criteria (e.g., artist, mood, Action movies etc.). Choosing which set of carousels to display is a difficult problem because it needs to account for how the different recommendation lists interact, e.g., avoiding duplicate recommendations, and how they help the user explore the catalogue. We focus in particular on the adiabatic computing paradigm and use the D-Wave quantum annealer, which is able to solve NP-hard optimization problems, can be programmed by classical operations research tools and is freely available on the cloud. We propose a formulation of the carousel selection problem for black box recommenders, that can be solved effectively on a quantum annealer and has the advantage of being simple. We discuss its effectiveness, limitations and possible future directions of development.  2021 Owner/Author.",2021,4/11/2022 15:14,5/13/2022 22:04,,691-696,,,,,,,RecSys 2021 - 15th ACM Conference on Recommender Systems,,,,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","Virtual, Online, Netherlands",,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\B9BIPMP8\Ferrari Dacrema et al. - 2021 - Optimizing the selection of recommendation carouse.pdf; ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3460231.3478853,Optimization; Annealing; Quantum computers; Recommender systems; Operations research; User interfaces; Video on demand; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball,,,,YES,YES,YES,N/A,N/A,YES,NO,N/A,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,N/A,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,0.714285714,0.866666667,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

Here, CEED is represented using cubic criterion function to reduce the nonlinearities of the system. Along with economic load dispatch, emissions of SO2, NOx, and CO2 are considered as separate three objectives, thus making it a four-objective (many-objective) optimization problem. A unit-wise price penalty factor is considered here to convert all the objectives into a single objective in order to compare the final results with other previously used methods like Lagrangian relaxation (LR), particle swarm optimization, and simulated annealing. QBA is applied in six-unit power generation system for four different loads. The obtained results show QBA successfully solve many-objective CEED problem with greater superiority than other methods found in the literature in terms of quality results, robustness, and computational performance. In the end of this paper, a detailed future research direction is provided based on the simulation results and its analysis. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the inclusion of quantum computing idea in metaheuristic technique provides a useful and reliable tool for solving such many-objective optimization problem.",2019-10,4/11/2022 15:14,5/11/2022 16:34,,5857-69,,10,31,,Neural Computing and Applications,,Neural Comput.

Inspired by strong non-linear learning capability of support vector regression (SVR), this paper presents an SVR model hybridized with the differential empirical mode decomposition (DEMD) method and quantum particle swarm optimization algorithm (QPSO) for electric load forecasting. The DEMD method is employed to decompose the electric load to several detail parts associated with high frequencies (intrinsic mode function-IMF) and an approximate part associated with low frequencies. Hybridized with quantum theory to enhance particle searching performance, the so-called QPSO is used to optimize the parameters of SVR. The electric load data of the New South Wales (Sydney, Australia) market and the New York Independent System Operator (NYISO, New York, USA) are used for comparing the forecasting performances of different forecasting models.

In reality, demand of a certain product becomes highly effected by on-hand stock level in stores and the selling price of the product. In the proposed model, demand of the product is dependent on these two vital deceive factors. In real life production systems, always there are some defective products which requires reworking in order to make them useful. The possibility of producing some defective items in regular production process and their reworking has been taken into account in the model. In case of inventories of highly demandable products, it is observed that production rate is proportional to demand. The situation also arises in case of launching a new product or in a multi-stage production system. In this model, production rate is a variable and it varies with the demand rate. Shortages are allowed and it is backlogged fully. Based on these assumptions, several researchers worked on but they considered that the associated inventory cost parameters are fixed real numbers. However, these are not fixed in reality and may vary time to time depending upon some scenario. Main objective of the paper is to develop a production inventory model under those assumptions considering various cost parameters as interval numbers. As a result the corresponding optimization problem is also interval valued. Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique has been applied to find the maximum profit in a single cycle. Numerical example and sensitivity analysis are given to illustrate the proposed inventory model.  2019, The Society for Reliability Engineering, Quality and Operations Management (SREQOM), India and The Division of Operation and Maintenance, Lulea University of Technology, Sweden.",2020,4/11/2022 15:14,5/4/2022 11:23,,385-399,,2,11,,International Journal of Systems Assurance Engineering and Management,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Publisher: Springer,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\TY5WT3EX\Ruidas et al. - 2020 - An EPQ model with stock and selling price dependen.pdf; ,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13198-019-00867-w,Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Numerical methods; Sensitivity analysis; Inventory control; Defects; included; reverse snowball; forward snowball,,,,NO,N/A,NO,YES,N/A,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,N/A,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,YES,0.25,0.857142857,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

In this model, the wavelet packet decomposition method is used to reasonably decompose the high-frequency fluctuation and low-frequency fluctuation of renewable energy to achieve the function of stabilizing fluctuation. Meanwhile, an operation strategy for hybrid energy storage to participate in demand response is proposed.

Most often software product developments are iterative and incremental in their nature, due to the changes in the customer requirements from time to time. It is a challenging task to select the requirements from a large number of candidates, for the accomplishment of the business goals. The problem is to identify a set of requirements to be included in the next release of the product, by minimizing the cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction. Since minimizing the total cost and maximizing the customer satisfaction are contradictory objectives, the problem has a multi-objective nature. This problem is NP-hard in its nature and so it cannot be solved efficiently by using traditional optimization techniques for large problem instances. QEMEA combines the best features of Evolutionary Algorithms and Quantum Computing. It employs the concepts of Quantum computing such as superposition and interference. The features of QEMEA help in achieving quality pareto-optimal front solutions and faster convergence while using a small population size.

Among others, an important goal is the minimization of the total transit time of the passengers. The corresponding objective function is quadratic in the binary decision variables encoding the flight-to-gate assignment. Hence, it is a quadratic assignment problem being hard to solve in general. In this work we investigate the solvability of this problem with a D-Wave quantum annealer. These machines are optimizers for quadratic unconstrained optimization problems (QUBO). Therefore the flight gate assignment problem seems to be well suited for these machines. We use real world data from a mid-sized German airport as well as simulation based data to extract typical instances small enough to be amenable to the D-Wave machine. In order to mitigate precision problems, we employ bin packing on the passenger numbers to reduce the precision requirements of the extracted instances. We find that, for the instances we investigated, the bin packing has little effect on the solution quality.

Quantum Genetic Algorithm (QGA), which originates from the organic integration of quantum computing and genetic algorithms, has the advantages of outstanding ability to seek optimal solutions, faster computing speed and smaller overall computing scale, and can solve multi-objective scheduling or optimization problems well. In this paper, the QGA's principle, method and basic flow is introduced, the constraints of the complex curriculum arrangement problem is discussed, and a method to solve the problem of course scheduling in colleges and universities by using this advanced algorithm is also given. The experimental result shows that the quantum genetic evolutionary algorithm is much better than the genetic algorithm, and the optimization results are ideal.",2019-06,4/25/2022 14:50,5/11/2022 16:38,,3783-3787,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 1948-9447,,; ; C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\AMHIW5FT\8832728.html; C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\N76G9NCJ\Shuguang and Lin - 2019 - Research on Complex Curriculum Arrangement Problem.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2019.8832728; http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/CCDC.2019.8832728,quantum computing; evolutionary computation; genetic algorithms; scheduling; included; educational courses; reverse snowball; forward snowball,Optimization; Genetic algorithms; Logic gates; Quantum computing; Scheduling; Statistics; Sociology; Genetic algorithm; Complex curriculum arrangement problem; Quantum genetic evolutionary algorithm; Timetable,,2019 Chinese Control And Decision Conference (CCDC),YES,NO,NO,YES,N/A,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.333333333,0.466666667,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

Economic dispatch problem refers to the minimization of generation cost, where environmental dispatch problem refers to the minimization of emission of pollutants like CO2, SO2, and NOx from the power generation system.

Emissions of CO2, SO2, and NOx are considered 3 different objectives, thus making it a 4-objective problem considering ED. Many-objective EED problems are defined by using a cubic criterion function, and a max/max price penalty factor is considered to convert all the objectives into a single objective to compare the final results with other well-known methods found in the literature like Lagrangian relaxation, particle swarm optimization, simulated annealing, and quantum-behaved bat algorithm.

In Asia, the traffic situation can be further deteriorated by road sharing of scooters. How to control the traffic flow to mitigate the congestion has been one of the central issues in transportation research. In this study, we employ a quantum annealing approach to optimize the traffic signals control at a real-life intersection with mixed traffic flows of vehicles and scooters. Considering traffic flow is a continuous and emerging phenomenon, we used quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) formalism for traffic optimization, which has a natural equivalence to the Ising model and can be solved efficiently on the quantum annealers, quantum computers or digital annealers. In this article, we first applied the QUBO traffic optimization to artificially generated traffic for a simple intersection, and then we used real-time traffic data to simulate a real ""Dongda-Keyuan"" intersection with dedicated cars and scooter lanes, as well as mixed scooter and car lanes. We introduced two types of traffic light control systems for traffic optimization: C-QUBO and QUBO. Our rigorous QUBO optimizations show that C-QUBO and QUBO outperform the commonly used fixed cycle method, with QUBO outperforming C-QUBO in some instances. It has been found that QUBO optimization significantly relieves traffic congestion for the unbalanced traffic volume.

A novel hybrid multi-step-ahead forecast model is introduced to solve this problem. Partial autocorrelation function (PACF) is first used to analyze the characteristics of the target time series for extracting the appropriate input variables. Least-square support vector machine (LSSVM) with recursive mechanism is then explored for modelling multi-step-ahead forecasts, in which the forecast model is adjusted adaptively as long as new information is updated. The parameters in LSSVM are optimized based on an improved quantum-inspired version of Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO). The QGWO fortifies against the stagnation of the wolves at an optimal local point using three strategies including the quantum operator, non-linear convergence factor, and dynamic weighting. In this paper, the performance of QGWO was first demonstrated with that of other meta-heuristic (MH) algorithms in solving eight mathematical benchmark problems. Two time series of reservoir water availability in Zhoushan Islands, China, were then provided and analyzed to validate the performance of the advanced forecast approach in multi-step-ahead forecasts. The forecasts were compared with those obtained by the non-adaptive (NA) and non-recursive (NR) models. Results indicate that (1) QGWO displays superior performance on model parameters optimization than other comparative MH algorithms; (2) The proposed hybrid model in consideration of the nearest anterior feedback, as well as the adaptive mechanism, not only outperforms the two comparative models (NA, NR) but significantly enhances the accuracy of multi-step-ahead forecasts for non-stationary time series and low or high volume events, even as the forecast time horizon increases.",2021,5/3/2022 16:13,5/15/2022 16:40,,125769,,,597,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\IUR5G3PH\Guo et al. - 2021 - Multi-step-ahead forecast of reservoir water avail.pdf,,included,Adaptive and recursive mechanism; Island areas; Multi-step-ahead forecast; Quantum Grey Wolf Optimizer (QGWO); Reservoir water availability,,,YES,YES,YES,N/A,N/A,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,YES,0.75,0.666666667,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

After reducing NSP to a novel Ising-type Hamiltonian, we evaluate the solution quality obtained from the D-Wave 2000Q against the constraint requirements as well as the diversity of solutions. For the test problems explored here, our results indicate that quantum annealing recovers satisfying solutions for NSP and suggests the heuristic method is potentially achievable for practical use. Moreover, we observe that solution quality can be greatly improved through the use of reverse annealing, in which it is possible to refine returned results by using the annealing process a second time. We compare the performance of NSP using both forward and reverse annealing methods and describe how this approach might be used in practice.",2019,5/4/2022 10:49,5/16/2022 16:18,,12837,,1,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,included,,,,YES,YES,NO,YES,N/A,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.555555556,0.733333333,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

Now, one major drawback of the available models is that they consider the amount of carbon emission associated with various inventory processes like setup process, production process, inventory holding process, etc. as fixed numbers. However, these quantities may not be fixed in reality due to several factors, like the condition of the carbon filtrating apparatus in the production firm, machine breakdown, quality of the raw material, nature of the fuel or energy used, etc. The parameters may vary in between some certain ranges. This paper aims at developing an imperfect production inventory model under the various carbon emission regulatory policies where the various carbon emission parameters are interval numbers. The various inventory cost parameters are also represented as interval numbers to reflect the practical situation. The demand of the product is assumed to be a linearly decreasing function of the selling price of the product. Also, the idea of a new inventory cost component, referred to as the ‘development cost’ is introduced. Four different policies- simple tax policy, cap and purchase policy, cap and reward policy and strictly under permitted cap policy are discussed, and based on those policies four different inventory models are developed. The Quantum behaved Particle Swarm Optimization(QPSO) algorithm has been applied to find the optimal profit of the manufacturer. The optimal profit obtained here is also an interval number which is quite realistic. The traditional fuzzy or probabilistic approach to represent impreciseness fails to find such kind of solution. A numerical example for every case has been given to illustrate the applicability of the models. Finally, sensitivity analysis of the optimal feasible solution due to variation in some key parameters has been provided with the key managerial insights.",2021-04-01,5/4/2022 11:21,5/18/2022 11:46,5/4/2022 11:21,107154,,,154,,Computers & Industrial Engineering,,,,,,,,en,,,,,ScienceDirect,,,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\ISRLT4XK\Ruidas et al. - 2021 - A production inventory model with interval-valued .pdf,,included,Sustainable production; Imperfect production system; Interval number; Inventory model; Quantum behaved particle swarm optimization technique,,,NO,N/A,YES,N/A,N/A,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,NO,YES,YES,N/A,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.571428571,0.571428571,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

D-Wave Systems, Inc. has since implemented commercial embodiments. We focus on the use of that hardware to solve discrete hydrologic inverse problems, which can become computationally intense at even moderate sizes. In particular, we interrogate whether contemporary quantum annealers with more qubits, lower noise, and reverse annealing features can improve performance. We find modest improvements in speed and accuracy are possible; however, those benefits are currently constrained to a regime of very rapid, approximate solutions on small meshes. As quantum annealers continue to improve, we expect further encroachment on the performance of classical numerical solvers.",2021-09,5/4/2022 11:58,5/18/2022 11:56,,1-6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE Xplore,,ISSN: 2643-1971,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\6PTUDJEA\9622819.html; C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\N3MJYDX2\Henderson et al. - 2021 - Interrogating the performance of quantum annealing.pdf,,included,Annealing; Quantum annealing; Computers; hydrology; Inverse problems; Hardware; Quantum mechanics; Qubit; D-Wave; quantum annealing; quantum mechanics; combinatorial optimization; 2000Q; Darcy’s law; low noise; reverse annealing,,2021 IEEE High Performance Extreme Computing Conference (HPEC),YES,YES,NO,YES,N/A,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,NO,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.555555556,0.533333333,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

These applications require the high quality of different network resources such as bandwidth, delay, jitter, and packet loss rate. In this paper, we propose an improved quantum chaotic animal migration optimization algorithm to solve the multicast routing problem (Multi-Constrained Least Cost MCLC). We used a quantum representation of the solutions that allow the use of the original AMO version without discretization, as well as improving AMO by introducing chaotic map to determine the random numbers. These two contributions improve the diversification and intensification of the algorithm. The simulation results show that our proposed algorithm has a good scalability and efficiency compared with other existing algorithms in the literature.",2018,5/4/2022 12:34,5/16/2022 19:11,,128-139,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-319-89743-1_12,,,,included,,,,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,N/A,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,YES,0.777777778,0.733333333,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

The analyses suggest that the good solutions are clustered in the search space and there is a correlation between the ﬁtness of a local optimum and its distance to the best solution. Inspired by these ﬁndings, a new operator for Quantum Evolutionary Algorithms is proposed which, during the search process, collects information about the ﬁtness landscape and tried to capture the backbone structure of the landscape. The knowledge it has collected is used to guide the search process towards a better region in the search space. The proposed algorithm consists of two phases. The ﬁrst phase uses a tabu mechanism to collect information about the ﬁtness landscape. In the second phase, the collected data are processed to guide the algorithm towards better regions in the search space. The algorithm clusters the good solutions it has found in its previous search process. Then when the population is converged and trapped in a local optimum, it is divided into sub-populations and each sub-population is designated to a cluster. The information in the database is then used to reinitialize the q-individuals, so they represent better regions in the search space. This way the population maintains diversity and by capturing the ﬁtness landscape structure, the algorithm is guided towards better regions in the search space.

This paper proposes a novel technique for accurate failure prognosis based on back propagation neural network and quantum multi-agent algorithm. Inspired by the extensive research of quantum computing theory and multi-agent systems, the technique employs a quantum multi-agent strategy, with the main characteristics of quantum agent representation and several operations including fitness evaluation, cooperation, crossover and mutation, for parameters optimization of neural network to avoid the deficiencies such as slow convergence and liability of getting stuck to local minima. To validate the feasibility of the proposed approach, several numerical approximation experiments were firstly designed, after which real vibrational data of bearings from the Laboratory of Cincinnati University were analyzed and used to assess the health condition for a given future point. The results were rather encouraging and indicated that the presented forecasting method has the potential to be utilized as an estimation tool for failure prediction in industrial machinery.",2016-06-01,5/5/2022 18:26,5/16/2022 21:07,5/5/2022 18:26,210-228,,2,25,,J.

Focusing on this problem, this paper has carried out a study on the multi-objective configuration optimization method (COM) and energy management strategy (EMS) for ship hybrid energy systems based on quantum computing. First, the mathematical model of distributed power modules of the hybrid energy system is established, and a configuration optimization objective function that aims at low-cost, long equipment life, and high reliability of power supply is constructed. Then, the combination with fuzzy rules and quantum multi-objective artificial bee colony algorithm to solve the objective function, the configuration scheme satisfying multiple constraints is obtained. On this basis, an energy management optimization objective function that meets both low-cost operation and maximum clean energy utilization for ship electric power system is established, an objective function is optimized in multi-objective quantum particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm, the real-time optimal scheduling for hybrid energy systems of the ship is realized. Experiments on actual navigation data verify the feasibility of the multi-objective configuration optimization method using the quantum artificial bee colony (QABC) algorithm. Furthermore, energy management experiments using different strategies, experimental results show that the energy management strategy proposed in this paper outperforms other methods, effectively reduces the operating costs, fuel costs, and pollutant emissions of marine power system, meet the environmental requirements of the Energy Efficiency Operating Index (EEOI) for ships.",2022,5/11/2022 15:23,5/12/2022 23:07,,124131,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,C:\Users\cfpgo\Zotero\storage\Y4Z27BYU\Si et al. - 2022 - Configuration optimization and energy management o.pdf,,included,,,,YES,YES,YES,N/A,N/A,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,YES,0.75,0.733333333,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

The indirect optimization method, based on Pontryagin’s maximum principle (PMP), is applied to optimize fuel consumption. To overcome the difficulty in nonsmooth integration caused by the bang-bang control, the homotopy method is adopted to solve the fuel-optimal problem from a related energy-optimal problem. The quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm is used to obtain the energy-optimal solutions. The energy-optimal solutions are used as the initial values for the homotopic procedure to obtain the fuel-optimal solutions and optimal bang-bang control law. A hybrid algorithm combined homotopy method and sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm is proposed. This hybrid algorithm can effectively obtain feasible optimal solutions even though the indirect optimization method exhibits a narrow convergence domain. Simulations of high-thrust and low-thrust rendezvous problems are provided and the proposed hybrid algorithm is verified.

The bat algorithm (BA) is an acknowledged metaheuristic optimization algorithm owing to its performance. However, the classical BA presents some weaknesses, such as premature convergence. To withstand the drawbacks of the BA, quantum mechanics theories and Gaussian and Cauchy operators are integrated into the standard BA to enhance its effectiveness. Since the economic load dispatch is a nonlinear, complex and constrained optimization problem, its main objective is to reduce the total generation cost while matching the equality and inequality constraints of the system. The validity of the CGQBA is tested on six standard benchmark functions with different characteristics. The numerical results indicate that the CGQBA is effective and superior to many other algorithms. Moreover, the CGQBA is applied to solve the ELD problems on various test systems including 3,6,20, 40,110 and 160 implemented generating units. The simulation results illustrate the strength of the CGQBA compared with other algorithms recently reported in the literature.",2021,5/11/2022 14:23,5/13/2022 22:09,,3207-3228,,,9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,included,,,,YES,YES,NO,YES,N/A,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.777777778,0.733333333,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

This paper proposes a hybrid QC-based deep learning framework for fault diagnosis of electrical power systems that combine the feature extraction capabilities of conditional restricted Boltzmann machine with an efficient classification of deep networks. Computational challenges stemming from the complexities of such deep learning models are overcome by QC-based training methodologies that effectively leverage the complementary strengths of quantum assisted learning and classical training techniques. The proposed hybrid QC-based deep learning framework is tested on a simulated electrical power system with 30 buses and wide variations of substation and transmission line faults, to demonstrate the framework’s applicability, efficiency, and generalization capabilities. High computational efficiency is enjoyed by the proposed hybrid approach in terms of computational effort required and quality of diagnosis performance over classical training methods.

The results show that the QPSO algorithm can traverse and search for a task allocation plan with shorter path and less energy consumption for multiple AUV systems under the same constraints, so that the task allocation can reach the global optimal.

It arises in practical applications where a set of physical locations need to be equipped with services to satisfy demand within a certain area, while minimizing costs. In this paper we formulate the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem, apply the hybrid framework of the D-Wave quantum annealer to solve it, and investigate the feasibility of this approach. To improve the often suboptimal initial solutions found on the D-Wave system, we develop a hybrid quantum/classical optimization algorithm that starts from the seed solution and iteratively creates small subproblems that are more efficiently solved on the D-Wave but often still converge to feasible and improved solutions of the original problem. Finally we suggest some opportunities for increasing the accuracy and performance of our algorithm.",2020,5/11/2022 15:39,5/16/2022 14:41,,531-545,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,DOI: 10.1007/978-3-030-50433-5_41,,,,included,,,,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,N/A,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,NO,YES,YES,NO,YES,YES,YES,YES,YES,NO,N/A,NO,0.666666667,0.666666667,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,OK,,

Therefore, it is of great significance to extract the useful fault features and diagnose faults based on raw vibration signals. In this paper, a novel deep feature learning method based on the fused-stacked autoencoders (AEs) for planetary gear fault diagnosis was proposed. First, to improve the data learning ability and the robustness of feature extraction process of AE model, the sparse autoencoder (SAE) and the contractive autoencoder (CAE) were studied, respectively. Then, the quantum ant colony algorithm (QACA) was used to optimize the specific location and key parameters of SAEs and CAEs in deep learning architecture, and multiple SAEs and multiple CAEs were stacked alternately to form a novel deep learning architecture, which gave the deep learning architecture better data learning ability and robustness of feature extraction. The experimental results show that the proposed method can address the raw vibration signals of planetary gear.
